_t4 		Clifford and the Big Parade . 
_t4 		I'm Emily Elizabeth and Clifford is my dog . 
_t4 		we live in a great town . 
_t4 		last year our town celebrated its birthday with special events and a big parade . 
_t4 		everyone wanted to look the way people did one hundred years ago . 
_t4 		they dressed up in old+fashioned clothes . 
_t4 		xxx beards . 
_t4 		Clifford and I dressed up too . 
_t4 		Clifford looked good in the fake beard I made for him . 
_t4 		we went to a city park to see the old+fashioned games and contest . 
_t4 		one team of little horses in the log+pulling contest was having a hard time . 
_t4 		Clifford felt sorry for them . 
_t4 		he gave them some help . 
_t4 		Clifford wanted to join the bicycle obstacle parade . 
_t4 		he couldn't ride a bike so +... 
_t4 		he got in the race as an obstacle . 
_t4 		he was a good one . 
_t4 		some men were pitching horseshoes . 
_t4 		Clifford wanted to try that too . 
_t4 		they made a mistake . 
_t4 		luckily I stopped him before it was too late . 
_t4 		don't throw the horse , Clifford . 
_t4 		next we played volleyball . 
_t4 		Clifford was keeping his eye on the ball .
_t4 
_t4 		but he forgot about the net . 
_t4 		poor , Clifford . 
_t4 		volleyball was not his game . 
_t4 		we saw some people getting for a pie+eating contest . 
_t4 		now that looked like something Clifford would enjoy . 
_t4 		it was . 
_t4 		Clifford was the champion pie eater . 
_t4 		afterward , Clifford tried to lift the pie crumbs off his fake beard . 
_t4 		some birds came to help .
_t4 
_t4 		the birds liked the beard more than Clifford did . 
_t4 		we left it behind and went off to get ready for the big parade . 
_t4 		there were bands and floats lining up in front of the school . 
_t4 		one float was being decorated with all kinds of flowers . 
_t4 		someone forgot that bees love flowers . 
_t4 		Clifford tried to shoo the bees away but that didn't work . 
_t4 		so he took a deep breath and blew those bees out of town . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		can you do that ? 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		the mayor did something special to thank Clifford for chasing the bees away .
_t4 
_t4 		good job .
_t4 
_t4 		he made Clifford the leader of the parade . 
_t4 		he gets to wear that hat and it says grand marshal . 
_t4 		at last , everything was ready . 
_t4 		we were going to march down Main Street and cross the town bridge . 
_t4 		suddenly , a man ran up and stopped the parade . 
_t4 		there was trouble ahead at the bridge . 
_t4 		Clifford and I rushed off as fast as we could go . 
_t4 		oh  , the bridge had collapsed . 
_t4 		Clifford did some quick thinking . 
_t4 		can you guess what happened then ? 
_t4 		the big parade went on as planned but Clifford wasn't in it . 
_t4 		he was +... 
