_t4 		right . 
_t4 		this one ? 
_t4 		Sophie in toy+land look at this book is coming apart . 
_t4 		Sophie was very sad she couldn't find Peter the panda anywhere . 
_t4 		he was her favorite toy and she took him to bed every night . 
_t4 		it was almost bedtime and Sophie didn't know how she'd get to sleep without him . 
_t4 		Sophie sat on Beauty her rocking+horse and rocked sadly back and forth . 
_t4 		hey you have a rocking+horse like that . 
_t4 		what's yours called ? 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		as her eyes filled with tears something she didn't know what made her rock faster than ever before she closed her eyes there was a tremendous whistling in her ears . 
_t4 		the next minute she was tumbling head over heels through the air then floating gently down to land on something soft . 
_t4 		Sophie blinked her eyes . 
_t4 		where was she exactly ? 
_t4 		hello Sophie growled a voice from above her head she opened her eyes and looked up . 
_t4 		the legs of a bed her bed towered above her it must have grown . 
_t4 		peaking over the edge of her quilt was big Ted next to him was little Ted . 
_t4 		see them ? 
_t4 		hello Sophie squeaked little Ted . 
_t4 		her teddy bears were talking she looked around she was tiny . 
_t4 		help she gulped I'm tiny I've shrunk her eyes filled with tears . 
_t4 		hello Sophie welcome to toy+land called a voice from across the room . 
_t4 		can you point to where you think Samantha Sophie's doll is ? 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		you're as tall as I am gasped Sophie . 
_t4 		I'm no bigger than my own doll what's going on ? 
_t4 		don't cry said Samantha gently you're in toy+land that's all . 
_t4 		we're all little here you'll grow big when Beauty takes you home again . 
_t4 		Sophie turned her head . 
_t4 		Beauty now tiny just like her was on the floor beside her . 
_t4 		how come Beauty got small too ? 
_t4 		(be)cause +... 
_t4 		xxx let's let Violet answer .
_t4 
_t4 		even the toy shrank ? 
_t4 		in toy+land ? 
_t4 		no it's because that's a big toy . 
_t4 		look out below cried big Ted we're coming down squeaked little Ted . 
_t4 		big Ted tied one end of a cord to the bed and dropped the other end to the floor it was the sash of Sophie's bathrobe the bears climbed down it . 
_t4 		let's call the other toys suggested Samantha wake up everybody she cried . 
_t4 		suddenly all of Sophie's toys sprang to life . 
_t4 		Sophie's tiniest dolls dashed out of the dollhouse and the toys that had been put into the toy+box jumped down from it . 
_t4 		let's play suggested big Ted . 
_t4 		this is fun said Sophie . 
_t4 		as she played games with her toys would you like to do that Violet ? 
_t4 		oh yeah . 
_t4 		is that how she's gonna get her panda ? 
_t4 		where's +//.
_t4 
_t4 		oh yeah I don't know . 
_t4 		where's Peter asked Sophie suddenly . 
_t4 		they looked everywhere but Peter the panda was no where to be found . 
_t4 		they gazed at each other in dismay then Sophie heard a soft noise . 
_t4 		everyone stood still and listened . 
_t4 		someone's calling said the fairy doll who had very good hearing . 
_t4 		it's coming from the top of the bookcase said Sophie . 
_t4 		they crowded beneath the bookcase a tiny black and white head appeared over the top high above them it was Peter the panda . 
_t4 		I'm stuck he squeaked in a tiny voice . 
_t4 		gosh said Sophie I must have put you there when I was told to straighten up my room . 
_t4 		please get me down begged Peter the panda but how asked Sophie . 
_t4 		the bookcase is so high and we're so little . 
_t4 		what can they do Violet ? 
_t4 		you know what I think they should do ? 
_t4 		I think she should go back on her horse and get big again and then she can just walk right over to it and pick it up right ? 
_t4 		I know a way said big Ted he ran off and came back pushing Sophie's toy fire engine we can use this what a good idea . 
_t4 		it stretched higher and higher into the air just the way a real fire engine's ladder does until the very top of it was resting against the bookcase . 
_t4 		now climb down Peter shouted Samantha . 
_t4 		oh no I can't said Peter don't worry said big Ted I'll get him down . 
_t4 		he climbed up the ladder and lifted Peter onto his shoulders . 
_t4 		everybody cheered and clapped when big Ted carried Peter safely to the ground . 
_t4 		thank you said Sophie hugging big Ted and kissing his cheek . 
_t4 		just then the clock on the bedroom wall went cuckoo [x 
_t4 		uh+oh said Sophie it's time for bed I have_to go . 
_t4 		bye bye toys thank you . 
_t4 		goodbye shouted the toys . 
_t4 		please come again . 
_t4 		Sophie climbed onto the back of the magic rocking horse and began to rock . 
_t4 		in an instant she was back in her bedroom a big girl again . 
_t4 		big Ted and little Ted were slumped at the foot of the bed . 
_t4 		the fire+engine with Samantha the doll leaning against it was down on the floor . 
_t4 		the rest of the toys were all back in their normal places . 
_t4 		it seemed as though Sophie's adventure in toy+land never happened . 
_t4 		the sash of her bathrobe was still dangling down the side of the bed and Peter the panda was lying safe on Sophie's pillow . 
_t4 		lucky Sophie had been to toy+land she had a delightful adventure with all her toys and she had found Peter and panda too . 
_t4 		now she couldn't wait to go to bed . 
_t4 		Peter and panda  .
_t4 
_t4 		Peter the panda . 
_t4 		she couldn't wait to go to bed and dream about her wonderful adventure . 
_t4 		hey I think it was a dream do you ? 
_t4 		do you think it was a dream  ?
_t4 
_t4 		and she woke up and she had her she had her bear with her .
_t4 
_t4 		Max do you want me to get the Legos out for you to play for a little while ?
_t4 
_t4 		xxx maybe it's just a  . 
_t4 		(be)cause I wanted to do a puzzle with Violet Violet you wanna [: want to] do the dinosaur floor puzzle with me while Max does his Legos for a few minutes ?
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		unicorn one .
_t4 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		the spring unicorn ?
_t4 
_t4 		okay then that's it (be)cause these are long ones .
_t4 
_t4 		(o)kay ? 
_t4 		the people of Feria are always happy for the summers are long the falls are beautiful the springs are a joy and the winters although a little cold are short . 
_t4 		so they rarely work and instead spend their days playing having parties making music and telling each other wonderful stories . 
_t4 		hey I wanna go there do you ? 
_t4 		what are  ? 
_t4 		mhm . 
_t4 		some people might say that they are lazy but they wouldn't care because they're just so happy . 
_t4 		but one year it wasn't like that . 
_t4 		that year in fact the people of Feria were far from happy indeed they were very worried . 
_t4 		for although spring should have arrived weeks before it hadn't none of the winter snows were gone yet . 
_t4 		and lakes had not thawed the birds were not building their nests and the buds of the flowers in the mountain meadows had had failed to open . 
_t4 		not good enough said the king something must be done . 
_t4 		which one you think's [: think is] the king Vi(olet) ? 
_t4 		let Violet choose please Maxwell . 
_t4 		which one do you think Vi(olet) ? 
_t4 		the same as he said ? 
_t4 		I was gonna guess that guy . 
_t4 		(be)cause you know why ? 
_t4 		he looks older and he was the one talking but then when Max pointed to that one I think he's right because that one has the crown on . 
_t4 		right ? 
_t4 		but it's funny the king's [: king is] usually old isn't he ? 
_t4 		all the men and women of great council except for one shook their heads for they did not know the answer but the oldest and wisest member stood up .
_t4 
_t4 		it is because the spring unicorn the bringer of spring has not visited Feria this year he explained without his arrival there can be no spring . 
_t4 		the king and the other members of the council looked at each other and frowned but why has the spring unicorn not come to Feria asked the king . 
_t4 		doesn't he like us anymore ? 
_t4 		I think it could be because we are so busy enjoying ourselves that we never thank the spring unicorn for all he does for us it could be that he thinks we are lazy and don't deserve to live in such a wonderful place suggested the wisest council member . 
_t4 		but we must pay that put that right at once said the king all the people in the land must leave the warmth of their homes and go out and start work immediately . 
_t4 		they must start  they must  . 
_t4 		the king wanted to describe the sorts of things that people should be doing when they went out to work but the trouble was he knew nothing about work so he didn't know what to say . 
_t4 		finally he said they &er they must you know they must bustle about being busy doing work and things . 
_t4 		do you know what a work thing is Violet ? 
_t4 		sweeping is one kind of work do you know any other kind of work ?
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		in the winter yeah that's a type of work in the winter . 
_t4 		digging too yep [: yes] so because the king told them to the people of Feria went to work at first they didn't even know what to do . 
_t4 		then when they looked up the word in the Feria dictionary and they found out what was involved they didn't like the sound of it and grumbled a lot among themselves . 
_t4 		but as time passed they discovered that they actually enjoyed being busy they shoveled the snow from the paths in their gardens they cleared snow from the roads +... 
_t4 		they repaired leaking roofs and they even filled all the holes in the road . 
_t4 		and they still laughed and sang the way they used to before the spring failed to arrive and the king ordered them all to go to work . 
_t4 		but it still kept snowing and the lakes didn't thaw and the birds failed to build their nests and the flowers didn't bloom . 
_t4 		what can be the matter now the king asked the oldest and wisest member of his council . 
_t4 		perhaps the spring unicorn doesn't know how hard we are working said the wise man . 
_t4 		well the spring unicorn must be told snapped the king stamping his royal feet . 
_t4 		that very day messengers were sent throughout the land to put up posters announcing that anyone who found the spring unicorn and explained how hard the Ferians had been working would receive all the gold they could wish for . 
_t4 		the problem was that nobody knew where the spring unicorn lived . 
_t4 		do you know where he lives Violet ? 
_t4 		and where's that ? 
_t4 		what do you call that place you think ? 
_t4 		he lives in the same place ? 
_t4 		how come they couldn't find him then ? 
_t4 		oh they didn't see him ? 
_t4 		he lives in the valley .
_t4 
_t4 		the problem was that nobody knew where the spring unicorn lived . 
_t4 		nobody that was except for a poor musician who was known as the Whistler . 
_t4 		I'm fed up with winter and I've got nothing to better to do so I might just as well go and look for the spring unicorn thought the Whistler . 
_t4 		see him here ? 
_t4 		so he picked up his flute and set off in search of the spring unicorn he traveled far and wide playing his flute to keep him cheerful on his journey . 
_t4 		and as he played the notes of the flute danced before him leading him on and on across the widest ocean over the highest mountains . 
_t4 		I shall follow the notes of my music wherever they lead me he told himself at long last he came to a valley . 
_t4 		hey Max you're right ! 
_t4 		where no one had ever been before it was the home of the spring unicorn you have no place here boomed a loud voice how how did you a mere Ferian find your way here ? 
_t4 		I played my flute and followed the notes explained the Whistler . 
_t4 		then he demonstrated with a quick tune . 
_t4 		his music was so beautiful that within minutes a whole herd of magical unicorns appeared and danced before him . 
_t4 		when he had finally laid down his flute one of the unicorns trotted forward he introduced himself as the spring unicorn . 
_t4 		why are you here the spring unicorn asked . 
_t4 		because you failed to come to Feria this year . 
_t4 		ha exclaimed the spring unicorn I couldn't be bothered to come because the people of Feria are so lazy they do not deserve my beautiful springs . 
_t4 		but what you say is no longer true why not Vi(olet) ? 
_t4 		are the people lazy there ?
_t4 
_t4 		why not ? 
_t4 		now they are right ? 
_t4 		we are no longer lazy and we still have time to be happy telling each other wonderful tales and playing beautiful music . 
_t4 		maybe you are right said the spring unicorn when the tune had come to an end I'll tell you what I'll do . 
_t4 		providing you play your beautiful music on your journey back to Feria I shall accompany you . 
_t4 		and we shall see if the people are no longer lazy . 
_t4 		can I fly on your back asked the Whistler hopefully ? 
_t4 		no said the spring unicorn if we fly the journey will be over too quickly and I won't have time to listen to all that music I want you to play . 
_t4 		we shall walk back the way you came . 
_t4 		oh drat thought the Whistler but how do they walk across the ocean ? 
_t4 		xxx the Whistler returned the way he had come and through his journey he played the most beautiful music . 
_t4 		that the spring unicorn followed every step of the way . 
_t4 		eventually they arrived in the mountains above Feria look . 
_t4 		see them up there ? 
_t4 		the Whistler pointing down at the village see how hard the people are working ? 
_t4 		indeed they were some were shoveling snow from their gardens but as soon as they had finished more snow fell to replace it . 
_t4 		some were clearing snow from the roads . 
_t4 		some were fixing leaks but as soon as they finished more snow fell . 
_t4 		indeed they are working but are they happy in their work ? 
_t4 		listen sad the Whistler . 
_t4 		the unicorn listened . 
_t4 		faintly from the village came the sound of someone laughing someone else was whistling +... 
_t4 		someone else was singing . 
_t4 		oh yes said the Whistler I think you can say they are happy . 
_t4 		I believe you are right you shall have your spring back again . 
_t4 		I shall continue to bring a new spring year after year just as long as the people remain happy and contented and do not ever become lazy again . 
_t4 		and that's how it was and that's how it still is . 
_t4 		and the Whistler well he turned down the king's offer of riches in favor of becoming the spring unicorn's helper .
_t4 
_t4 		which is why every year the Ferian spring is always heralded by the most beautiful music anyone has ever heard . 
_t4 		wow . 
_t4 		this one's [: one is] called Floyd the friendly shark we'll read that one later . 
_t4 		let's look at the pictures though . 
