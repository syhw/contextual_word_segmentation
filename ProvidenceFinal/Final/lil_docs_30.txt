_d3310 		the beast smiled as he took her hand , and helped her into the sleigh . 
_d3310 		he didn't mention he had slept all morning polishing it just for her . 
_d3310 		once she was settled , he covered her with a warm blanket . 
_d3310 		they took off across the powdery snow , Belle laughed happily as the beast guided the sleigh through the forest path . 
_d3310 		soon they came to a clearing in the woods , before then was a frozen pond . 
_d3310 		the beast pulled on the reins and stopped at the  the edge of the pond . 
_d3310 		this is such a magical place , said Belle , how did you ever find it ? 
_d3310 		I used to come here long ago , said the beast , it was one of y favorite places and I wanted to share it with you . 
_d3310 		then the beast took out a picnic basket filled with snacks . 

_d3310 		when they had finished their meal , the beast asked Belle if she wanted to ice skate . 
_d3310 		oh yes , she said , father and I used to go every winter , I love ice skating . 
_d3310 		soon Belle was spinning effortlessly across the pond's smooth surface . 
_d3310 		the beast was less graceful , hitting a bump in the ice , he lost his balance and toppled to the ground . 
_d3310 		at first he was angry , but then he saw Belle looking at him kindly . 
_d3310 		remembering his friends' advice he smiled as Belle helped him to his feet . 
_d3310 		every one falls sometimes , said Belle , it's part of learning . 
_d3310 		before long they were gliding across the ice arm in arm , enjoying each other's company in the crisp winter air . 
_d3310 		they grew tired and decided to rest . 
_d3310 		just then , a timid fawn wandered out of the forest . 
_d3310 		poor thing , said Belle , she looks scared and hungry . 
_d3310 		taking an apple from their picnic basket , Belle showed the beast how to gently feed the young deer . 
_d3310 		soon the sun was setting , it was time to go , as they made their way home , Belle thought about the day she had spent with the beast . 
_d3310 		there was something different about him , he had shown her a kinder , softer side . 
_d3310 		perhaps they could be friends after all . 
_d3310 		is that what comes next ? 

_d3310 		I know , he said , we'll help Cinderella , and all the other mice nodded in agreement . 
_d3310 		what would I do without you , Cinderella said , patting them on the head , you're so good to me . 
_d3310 		everyone joined in the cleaning , singing happily as they went . 
_d3310 		as she worked , Cinderella began to imagine the magical evening ahead . 
_d3310 		everyone would be dressed in the the finest clothes , Cinderella would wear her mother's beautiful gown . 
_d3310 		the ballroom would come alive with music , dancing , and laughter and the handsome young prince would bow before Cinderella and ask her to dance . 
_d3310 		suddenly Cinderella stopped dreaming ,  no she said , I've never been to a ball , I don't even know how to dance ! 
_d3310 		don't worry Cinderella , Jacques smiled reassuringly . 
_d3310 		we'll show you how to dance , easy as pie . 
_d3310 		with that , Jacques bowed before Perla and extended his hand . 
_d3310 		dance please , he asked , Perla blushed as she took Jaques' hand . 
_d3310 		Gus was the conductor , he got all the birds to sing . 

_d3310 		using her broom as an imaginary partner , Cinderella danced and twirled gracefully through the room , she led everyone across the floor , sweeping and cleaning as they went . 
_d3310 		good Cinderella , said Jacques beaming , a lucky prince gets to dance with Cinderelli . 
_d3310 		and the mice collapsed on the floor laughing , thank you so much Cinderella said to her friends . 

_d3311 		I know , said Happy , maybe he's feeling sad and needs a little cheering up . 
_d3311 		I'm sure that would help , Happy , but it looks like he may need something more than a merry story or a song . 
_d3311 		I  I don't know for sure , said Bashful softly . 
_d3311 		but perhaps he's too shy to let us know what's the matter . 
_d3311 		we all feel shy sometimes , don't we Bashful , said Snow White . 

_d3329 		today , Franklin's class was going to the museum . 
_d3329 		Franklin was so excited that he could hardly eat his breakfast . 
_d3329 		the museum had lots_of steps and huge doors . 
_d3329 		wow: said Franklin , it's big . 
_d3329 		it has to be , said Beaver , there are real dinosaurs in there . 
_d3329 		do you remember in New York we went with grandma  and grandpa  to the museum with the dinosaurs ? 
_d3329 		yeah , that's called the museum of natural history in new+york . 
_d3329 		Beaver had been to the museum before , she knew everything about it . 
_d3329 		bi:g dinosaurs , she emphasized . 
_d3329 		so big that they ate trees for breakfast . 
_d3329 		Franklin was afraid to ask what dinosaurs ate for lunch . 
_d3329 		Franklin sat down on the steps . 
_d3329 		what's wrong , asked Snail . 
_d3329 		Beaver says there are real dinosaurs in the museum . 
_d3329 		Snail looked alarmed . 
_d3329 		that sounds scary . 
_d3329 		and Franklin nodded . 
_d3329 		we're not gonna get that . 
_d3329 		in the museum lobby , mr Owl went over the rules . 
_d3329 		no shouting , no running , and stay with the group . 
_d3329 		mr Owl said , Beaver , one more thing . 
_d3329 		watch out for the dinosaurs ! 
_d3329 		Moose and Bear laughed . 
_d3329 		but Franklin didn't , he moved a little closer to mr Owl . 
_d3329 		their first stop was the bat cave . 
_d3329 		it was dark inside . 
_d3329 		squeaks and squawks filled the air . 
_d3329 		what's that , asked Franklin . 
_d3329 		Beaver giggled . 
_d3329 		that's the sound bats make to find their way around . 
_d3329 		Franklin was relieved that it was bats , and not dinosaurs . 
_d3329 		the class visited the rainforest next . 
_d3329 		Franklin climbed high into a tree house . 
_d3329 		he could see the tops of trees . 
_d3329 		can you spot any dinosaurs , asked Snail . 
_d3329 		Franklin shook his head and climbed down quickly . 
_d3329 		there was so much to do in the museum that Franklin almost forgot about the dinosaurs . 
_d3329 		in the medieval room , Franklin had fun dressing up like a knight . 
_d3329 		xxx (.) we saw knights in the other museum in new+york , at the Metropolitan , right ? 

_d3329 		Franklin even got_to dig in a sandy pit . 
_d3329 		he was the first one to find an arrow head . 
_d3329 		it was just like being a real archaeologist . 
_d3329 		wow that's neat . 
_d3329 		an archeologist is when you dig in the sand for very old things . 
_d3329 		yeah . 
_d3329 		the best part is still to come , said Beaver as they sat down in the cafeteria . 
_d3329 		yes agreed Bear , lunch . 
_d3329 		mr Owl smiled , I think Beaver means the dinosaur exhibit . 
_d3329 		Franklin gulped , I'm too tired to see more , I think I'll stay here a while , he muttered . 
_d3329 		me too , said Snail . 
_d3329 		you'll forget about being tired when you see the dinosaurs , said mr Owl . 
_d3329 		eat up and let's go . 
_d3329 		reluctantly , Franklin and Snail followed the giant footprints down a long , leafy corridor . 
_d3329 		there was a loud roar . 
_d3329 		the floor shook and so did Franklin . 
_d3329 		a:h ! 
_d3329 		screamed Franklin when he turned the corner . 
_d3329 		he was looking right into the bony mouth of a tyrannosaurus . 
_d3329 		Franklin blinked . 
_d3329 		they're bones ? 
_d3329 		real dinosaur bones ? 
_d3329 		but the dinosaurs aren't even alive ! 

_d3329 		next time , said Beaver , you should visit the tomb , there's a mummy inside . 

_d3329 		yeah , and it's scary , said Beaver . 
_d3329 		but Franklin wasn't scared . 
_d3329 		he had a mummy at home . 
