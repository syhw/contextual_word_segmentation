_t4 		what does that say ?
_t4 
_t4 		this book belongs to Mommy . 
_t4 		that's right , this book belongs to Mommy .
_t4 
_t4 		(be)cause it was hers when she was little .
_t4 
_t4 		one day , Mister and Missus Brown were standing in Paddington station . 
_t4 		they were waiting for their daughter Judy , who was coming home from school . 
_t4 		Suddenly Mister Brown noticed something small and furry behind a pile of mail+bags . 
_t4 		look over there , he said to Missus Brown , I'm sure I saw a bear . 
_t4 		a bear , said Missus Brown , in Paddington station . 
_t4 		don't be silly Henry , there can't be . 
_t4 		but there was . 
_t4 		it had a funny kind of a hat and was sitting all by itself on an old suitcase near the lost property office .
_t4 
_t4 		oh , as they drew near the bear stood up and politely raised its hat . 
_t4 		good afternoon , it said in a small , clear voice , can I help you ? 
_t4 		we were wondering if we could help you , said Missus Brown , wherever have you come from ? 
_t4 		the bear looked (a)round carefully before replying . 
_t4 		darkest Peru , I stowed away and I lived on marmalade . 
_t4 		Missus bear spotted a label around the bear's neck , it said please look after this bear , thank you , Aunt Lucy . 
_t4 		Missus Brown went off to look for Judy and Mister Brown took Paddington into the cafeteria for something to eat . 
_t4 		he left Paddington sitting at a corner table near the window . 
_t4 		he soon returned , carrying two steaming cups of +... 
_t4 		tea !
_t4 
_t4 		and a large plate piled hi:gh with sticky cakes . 
_t4 		after his long journey Paddington was so hungry and thirsty he didn't know which to do first , eat or drink . 
_t4 		I think I'll try both at the same time , if you don't mind Mister Brown he announced . 
_t4 		and without waiting for a reply he climbed on the table . 
_t4 		Mister Brown stared out of the window pretending that he had tea with a bear at Paddington station every day of his life . 
_t4 		when Missus Brown came into the cafeteria with Judy she threw up her hands in horror . 
_t4 		Henry , she said , what are you doing to that poor bear , he's covered with cream and jam . 
_t4 		at the sound of Missus bear's voice Paddington jumped so much he stepped on a patch of strawberry jam and fell over backwards into his saucer of tea . 
_t4 		oh no .
_t4 
_t4 		I think we'd better go before anything else happens said Mister Brown , and he quickly led the way out of the cafeteria . 
_t4 		come along , she said , we'll take you home in a taxi . 
_t4 		then you can have a nice hot bath , and meet my brother Jonathan . 
_t4 		Paddington had never been in a taxi before , he found it ve:ry exciting . 
_t4 		and he stood on a little tip up seat behind the driver so he could wave to the people in the street .
_t4 		soon they pulled up outside a large house with a green front door . 
_t4 		when they were indoors , Judy took Paddington up to his room to unpack .
_t4 
_t4 		he has a picture of Aunt Lucy . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		next she showed Paddington the bathroom . 
_t4 		as soon as he was on his own , he turned on the taps , and climbed onto the stool in order to look out of the window .
_t4 
_t4 		then he tried to write his name on the steamy glass with his paw . 
_t4 		it took him rather a long time , and when he looked (a)round he found to his surprise that the bath was so full of water , it was starting to run over the side .
_t4 
_t4 		uh+oh . 
_t4 		uh+oh . 
_t4 		he closed his eyes and holding his nose with one paw he jumped in . 
_t4 		the water was hot and soapy and very deep and to his horror he couldn't get out . 
_t4 		he couldn't even turn the taps off . 
_t4 		Paddington tried calling out help , at first in a quiet voice so as not to disturb anyone , but then much louder , help help ! 
_t4 		but still nobody came . 
_t4 		then he had an idea . 
_t4 		he took off his hat and began using it to bail out the water .
_t4 
_t4 		downstairs , Judy was telling her brother all about Paddington . 
_t4 		when suddenly she felt a plop . 
_t4 		looking up she saw a dark wet patch on the ceiling . 
_t4 		Paddington , she cried , he must be in trouble , quick ! 
_t4 		and they raced out of the room and up the stairs .
_t4 
_t4 		Jonathan and Judy leaned over the side of the bath and lifted a dripping and very frightened Paddington onto the floor . 
_t4 		what a mess , said Jonathan , we'd better wipe it up pretty quickly . 
_t4 		oh Paddington , said Judy , what good luck we found you in time , you might have drowned . 
_t4 		Paddington sat up , what good like I had (.) my had he said . 
_t4 		some time later a beautifully clean Paddington came downstairs . 
_t4 		settling himself down in a small armchair by the fire , he put his paws behind his head and stretched out his toes . 
_t4 		it was nice being a bear , especially a bear called Paddington . 
_t4 		he had a feeling life with the Browns was going to be fun . 
_t4 		that's right , Paddington's [: Paddington is] lying on the chair with the pillows , he's relaxing . 
_t4 		ooh he's ve:ry comfortable . 
_t4 		shh he's going to sleep ,  .
