_t4 		Snow White is so sweet and gentle she makes lots_of friends wherever she goes . 
_t4 		she is always cheerful and looks on the bright side . 
_t4 		she is romantic and longs to meet her true+love . 
_t4 		she is also very practical and works very hard . 
_t4 		that's important mmmm+hmmm ? 
_t4 		you ate all the pez . 

_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		yes .
_t4 
_t4 		oh you can't have lunch okay well then if you can't have lunch then you can't have pez . 
_t4 		okay should we read about Snow White ? 
_t4 		with hair as black as ebony and lips as red as roses and skin as white as snow this lovely princess is perfectly named Snow White . 
_t4 		not only is she beautiful but she is sweet natured too . 
_t4 		everyone loves her except of course her vain and jealous stepmother the queen . 
_t4 		her favorite things include singing and dancing which always cheer her up and give her courage when she's afraid . 
_t4 		telling stories is one of Snow White's great talents the seven dwarfs like to listen to her stories about the day her prince will come and how they'll live in a beautiful castle . 
_t4 		the animals and birds of the forest love Snow White's kind and gentle nature . 
_t4 		they even helped her clean up the dwarfs' messy cottage . 
_t4 		Snow White loves to walk in the enchanted forest and pick pretty flowers . 
_t4 		but she can't things into the too many flowers into the cottage because flowers make Sneezy sneeze . 
_t4 		when dwarfs when the dwarfs find out that Snow White is a good cook they are delighted even more so when they discover she can bake their favorite gooseberry pie . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		beyond the farthest hill stands the castle where she grew up with her wicked stepmother . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ? 
_t4 		right it's true . 
_t4 		Snow White has nowhere to go and gets lost in the dense forest . 
_t4 		eventually she can run no farther and she falls to the ground in tears  . 
_t4 		the seven hills really are jeweled because there are dazzling diamonds inside . 
_t4 		the seven dwarfs love to dig dig dig all day long in the diamond mines . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		oh+my+goodness . 
_t4 		so this is where Snow White grew up . 
_t4 		and this is where the dwarfs live . 
_t4 		and that's the prince's castle . 
_t4 		and (.) those are the diamond mines . 
_t4 		and the waterfalls . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ? 
_t4 		well this is when Snow White is  lost in the dark forest . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		right she got lost but the nice animals helped her out right ? 
_t4 		and they took her to the seven dwarfs' cottage . 
_t4 		right ? 
_t4 		one of the great gifts that Snow White has is the ability to make friends easily . 
_t4 		the animals and dwarfs would do anything for her even Grumpy . 
_t4 		but the queen is madly jealous of her naturally beautiful stepdaughter and the cruel queen is a very dangerous enemy to have . 
_t4 		as well as being Snow White's stepmother +... 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ? 
_t4 		right it says here as well as being Snow White's stepmother the queen is also a wicked witch . 
_t4 		she does not like Snow White and she uses a poison apple to try and get rid of her . 
_t4 		my+goodness . 
_t4 		that's not nice at all . 
_t4 		no no no . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_t4 
_t4 		right it's true there is the poison apple . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		no no .
_t4 
_t4 		the seven dwarfs and the birds and animals that meet Snow White love her dearly . 
_t4 		they try to protect her from the wicked queen and her spells . 
_t4 		although the huntsman is a loyal servant of the queen +... 
_t4 		he is always so sleepy isn't he .
_t4 
_t4 		there's Sneezy . 
_t4 		choo .
_t4 
_t4 		that's right he's always sneezing . 
_t4 		that's right . 
_t4 		here's the huntsman he's a loyal servant of the queen but he is not wicked . 
_t4 		seeing Snow White's sweet nature he cannot bear to carry out the queen's orders and hurt the princess . 
_t4 		well but he decides he cannot hurt Snow White . 
_t4 		he doesn't want to hurt her so he lets her go . 
_t4 		right ? 
_t4 		no it's not nice that he promised to do it in the first place right ? 
_t4 		you're so soft . 
_t4 		yes ? 
_t4 		that's the queen's castle . 
_t4 		where Snow White grew up . 
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		not so good . 
_t4 		nope nope nope nope . 
_t4 		from the moment that Snow White becomes more beautiful than the queen her life is in danger . 
_t4 		although the seven dwarfs tried their best they cannot protect her from the queen's black magic . 
_t4 		but good is stronger than evil . 
_t4 		and in the end the prince's love for Snow White saves the day . 
_t4 		well at first he thinks he's going to hurt Snow White . 
_t4 		but then he changes his mind he can't bring himself to harm her . 
_t4 		and he tells Snow White to run away from the queen . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_t4 
_t4 		right .
_t4 
_t4 		disguised as an old peddler woman the queen persuades trusting Snow White to take a bite of the poisoned apple . 
_t4 		she promises it will make her dream come true . 
_t4 		yes ? 
_t4 		right .
_t4 
_t4 		as soon as Snow White takes a bite of the apple she falls to the ground in a deep sleep and cannot be woken . 
_t4 		when the dwarves find her they place her in a special glass coffin . 
_t4 		yes . 
_t4 		she is very very mean you're right . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		but the dwarfs and Snow White +... 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		but Snow White and the dwarfs and the prince are all very nice aren't they ? 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		you're so right . 
_t4 		she is not nice at all . 
_t4 		no no no no no . 
_t4 		he does not look so nice there either you're right . 
_t4 		Cinderella . 
_t4 		about Cinderella she is cheerful and sunny no matter how difficult things are . 
_t4 		she is hard working and practical and she can cook and sew . 
_t4 		she's very caring and heart is full of kindness . 
_t4 		that's nice . 
_t4 		poor Cinderella is made to work as a servant by her cruel stepmother and her spoiled stepsisters . 
_t4 		but she never stops hoping and believing that one day her life will change . 
_t4 		although they are only tiny mice Gus and Jack are Cinderella's loyal friends . 
_t4 		they help her with her chores and save her from being lonely mmmm+hmmm ? 

_t4 
_t4 		oh I see . 
_t4 		oh the chain of life will be broken ? 
_t4 		wow . 
_t4 		let's see . 
_t4 		Cinderella has no money to spend on clothes so her animal friends help her to patch up a simple dress an apron each morning and shine her worn out shoes . 
_t4 		the birds and mice sew frills and bows on an old dress that once belonged to her mother so that Cinderella can go to the ball . 
_t4 		uh+huh ? 
_t4 		well we don't get to meet her mother . 
_t4 		yeah ? 
_t4 		well Cinderella was with her mother when she was younger . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		that's right hello belly girl . 
_t4 		once upon a time the manor house was the happiest place in the whole kingdom . 
_t4 		but when Cinderella's mean stepmother arrived things changed . 
_t4 		Lady Chrimain is her stepmother . 
_t4 		oh+my+goodness gracious . 
_t4 		oh no . 
_t4 		right right .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		no . 
_t4 		this is the kitchen where Cinderella spends much of her day cooking and cleaning . 
_t4 		every morning Cinderella feeds the animals before she takes breakfast to her stepmother in bed . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ? 
_t4 		yes ? 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_t4 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		yes that was good . 
_t4 		a little magic is all Cinderella needs to find happiness . 
_t4 		she has charm and beauty and all the elegance of a princess . 
_t4 		and with a little help from her fairy godmother her dreams come true . 
_t4 		to celebrate the prince's return all eligible ladies in the land are invited to attend a ball at the castle . 
_t4 		well they are so jealous of Cinderella that they tear her outfit to pieces . 
_t4 		oh no .
_t4 
_t4 		but with a wave of her magic wand the fairy godmother ensures that Cinderella can go to the ball . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ? 
_t4 		oh no . 
_t4 		as soon as their eyes meet at the ball Cinderella and the prince fall in love . 
_t4 		but when the clock strikes mid  midnight Cinderella leaves her glass slipper behind on the stairs in a hurry to leave before the magic ends . 
_t4 		soon her dress +... 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		but she leaves it there . 
_t4 		and the grand duke is absolutely delighted when Cinderella produces the matching glass slipper and puts it on her dainty foot . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		that's true . 
_t4 		after all his searching Prince Charming has at last found the beautiful girl he danced with at the ball and the whole kingdom rejoices when he marries Cinderella . 
_t4 		hooray . 
_t4 		hooray . 
_t4 		oh . 

_t4 		Malificent is very offended when she is not invited to the royal party . 
_t4 		and she is so angry that she curses baby Aurora . 

_t4 		well no she doesn't die she just falls asleep . 

_t4 		but with the sword of truth and the shield of virtue he defeats her . 
_t4 		wow . 

_t4 		as far as Aurora is concerned her life has been uneventful . 
_t4 		for sixteen years she has lived in the forest longing for excitement and romance . 

_t4 		yesterday we went on a class trip to the museum of natural history . 
_t4 		we were very excited . 
_t4 		Gaspard and Lisa please try to stay out of trouble our teacher said as we got on the bus . 
_t4 		on the bus our teacher told us about some of the animal exhibits that we should see . 
_t4 		Lisa had been to the museum before and she said there was something even better dinosaurs so big one of their footprints could make a swimming pool for us . 
_t4 		the museum was very interesting our teacher showed us everything . 
_t4 		butterflies monkey tigers elephants and even the skeleton of a whale . 
_t4 		but the exhibit of extinct animals was the most exciting . 
_t4 		Gaspard and +/. 
_t4 		oh those are some extinct animals . 
_t4 		Gaspard and Lisa +/. 
_t4 		those are extinct animals which means they lived a very long time ago . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_t4 
_t4 		it looks like Gaspard and Lisa doesn't it ? 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		that's right . 
_t4 		Gaspard and Lisa our classmates joked you look like extinct animals . 
_t4 		the museum may want to keep you forever . 
_t4 		everyone laughed except for Lisa and me but it gave me an idea . 
_t4 		Lisa let's play a joke on our classmates I said and I told her my plan . 
_t4 		first we made two little signs and then we crept under the bars . 
_t4 		we put the signs in front of us and froze like statues . 
_t4 		I had forgotten to take off my scarf but our classmates didn't notice . 
_t4 		some of them even took pictures of us . 
_t4 		lots_of pictures . 
_t4 		our plan worked perfectly . 
_t4 		so perfectly that our class left without us . 
_t4 		the lights went out and the door closed  no . 
_t4 		we were locked in the museum . 
_t4 		what's to become of us Lisa cried ? 
_t4 		don't be afraid I answered we'll find something to eat we'll go to sleep and tomorrow we'll leave . 
_t4 		but the only thing to eat were dinosaur bones and in the dark they were sort of scary . 
_t4 		it was terrible being locked in the dark suddenly the dinosaurs started growling . 
_t4 		ah we shouted help . 
_t4 		but it wasn't the dinosaur it was the guard's dog who came to rescue us . 
_t4 		our teacher and classmates were happy to see us and boy were we happy to see them . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		let's put this one back . 
_t4 		hey . 
_t4 		yikes . 
_t4 		wow  really wow . 
_t4 		Nemo loved everything about school . 
_t4 		he loved swimming there everyday with his dad . 
_t4 		he loved his classmates he loved his teachers and he loved to learn . 
_t4 		and he really loved field trips . 
_t4 		even though on his very first trip he was fish+napped by a scuba+diving dentist and brought to an office aquarium in Sydney . 
_t4 		but that's another story . 
_t4 		every morning Nemo's dad Marlin would take him to school . 
_t4 		along the way Nemo always liked to ask his dad lots_of questions . 
_t4 		what's a whale's tongue like ? 
_t4 		how many clown+fish can a shark eat in one gulp ? 
_t4 		why are we called clown+fish asked Nemo ? 
_t4 		we're not funny at all . 
_t4 		Nemo saw his best friends Tadpole and Sheldon they loved to play tag and algae in the middle before school started . 
_t4 		Mr Ray was on school yard duty that morning he was everyone's favorite teacher . 
_t4 		Nemo and his friends had a special song they made up just for him . 
_t4 		he's our favorite teacher hip hip hooray . 
_t4 		before the big spotted manta we love Mr Ray . 
_t4 		then it was time for school to begin the first class of the day was music taught by +... 
_t4 		Senor Seaweed . 
_t4 		Nemo and his classmates were getting ready for the spring concert . 
_t4 		Nemo played the conch shell Sheldon played the clams Tad strummed along on some kelp and Pearl played sand+dollar tambourines . 
_t4 		Mr Ray taught science . 
_t4 		today's lesson was your ocean home . 
_t4 		Mr Ray called on Nemo where do you live Nemo ? 
_t4 		I mean +... 
_t4 		where does Nemo live ? 
_t4 		an anemone that's right . 
_t4 		while the rest of us would be hurt by its stings Nemo brushes himself against the anemone every day . 
_t4 		I guess Tad lives in the ocean . 
_t4 		hmmm really I think just clown+fish live in an anemone . 
_t4 		yup .
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm that's interesting . 
_t4 		then it was lunchtime . 
_t4 		there were lots_of lunchroom rules . 
