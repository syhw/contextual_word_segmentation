_t4 		why , because ships are for the ocean they're just for floating in the water , they don't come on land . 
_t4 		and sometimes if they hit the land they can break . 
_t4 		and water can get on the ship and it could sink , so they want to stay away from the land . 
_t4 		and when it's foggy they can't see the land . 
_t4 		and if they can't see the land they don't know where it is , that's why fog+horns help them , fog+horns help them know where the land is . 
_t4 		come sit here little ship . 
_t4 		so when it's really foggy all they have_to do is listen . 

_t4 		I think he was supposed to fix it so that it would say Mama again , two hands please . 
_t4 		oh . 
_t4 		but instead he fixed it and now it says Dada .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx , funny Mister Fixit . 

_t4 		they don't say what he does , it actually sounds not only mysterious , it sounds ominous ,  . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		Naima please don't wipe your hands on the table like that . 
_t4 		I don't want you to do that , are you gonna eat some egg white and egg yolk ? 

_t4 		no it's a big boat , somebody's in it while he's fixing it . 

_t4 		so that it won't sink . 
_t4 		if a boat has a leak it might sink . 
_t4 		it might go to the bottom .
_t4 
_t4 		
_t4 		I guess Philip's wagon was broken . 
_t4 		maybe the wheel was broken .
_t4 
_t4 		Mister Fixit likes to fix everything he touches practically .

_t4 		he must have been using the wrong directions . 
_t4 		when he was fixing it . 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		he was supposed to fix it so it said Mama .
_t4 
_t4 		but instead he fixed it so it said Dada . 
_t4 		I think he probably was (.) reading the wrong directions when he fixed it .
_t4 
_t4 		like sometimes you need directions to fix things , you need to read from a paper with directions . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		his refrigerator wasn't making any ice . 
_t4 		and he fixed it . 
_t4 		he had to read the directions for how to fix it . 
_t4 		and then he fixed it . 
_t4 		hmmm , and ,  .
_t4 
_t4 		remember , what was I reading  ,  , remember when I was trying to try out the backpack to carry you in ? 
_t4 		I had to read the directions . 

_t4 		I mean yesterday it was overcast much of the morning and then it burned off .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		it was spectacular . 
_t4 		a spectacular turnaround . 
_t4 		I wonder if fog is a mosquito deterrent . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		wishful thinking . 
_t4 		I don't think so .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		mosquitos repelled by fog ! 
_t4 		could be the cool temperatures associated with it .
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		there are probably many different kinds of fog . 

_t4 		why'ncha [: why don't you] eat some . 
_t4 		you can cut one piece and then I want you to eat it . 
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		is it really shorter to go on the ferries ? 
_t4 		oh it , in terms of amount of time , no it's probably shorter to go the other way cause [: because] I think if you drive to Eastport it's probably about an hour . 
_t4 		from here . 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		it's just it's more interesting and more broken up but you know , if you go by ferry , I mean if it's say fifteen minutes for the ferry , each ferry that's half an hour of a wait plus each one is about twenty+five minutes , that's an hour and a half plus the drive time , so +... 
_t4 		it's probably longer to go that way . 
_t4 		not that it'll be very spectacular , that is really one of , the Eastport to Deer Island ferry is just one of those local ferries .
_t4 
_t4 		well the thing is if we drove there , and then took the ferry back , by then it might not +...
_t4

_t4 		I think that's what you're asking .
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		cause [: because] I said maybe that's +... 
_t4 		well Mommy thought maybe mosquitos don't like fog , so that the fog will keep them away .
_t4 
_t4 		Mommy was more hoping that than thinking that .
_t4 
_t4 		I think Mommy was engaging in something called wishful thinking .
_t4 
_t4 		yes . 
_t4 		that's called wishful thinking , that's when you wish something's true .
_t4 
_t4 		even if it's not . 
_t4 		I don't think toddlers are supposed to have that level of reasoning yet . 

_t4 
_t4 		you don't need to hear what you think +//? 
_t4 		what , what I think about it ?
_t4 
_t4 		because things are more stable if they're not on just one lego . 
_t4 		see how this is wider ? 
_t4 		if you put the wider legos on the bottom it'll be more stable . 
_t4 		see this is wider (.) and this is skinny and narrow . 
_t4 		if you put the narrow towers on top of the wider towers it'll be more stable . 
_t4 		yeah , even that is better . 
_t4 		that , if I were you I'd put that on the bottom . 
_t4 		'cause [: because] that's really stable , that's like a platform . 
_t4 		it's a pretty big tower though . 
_t4 		and you're doing a good job by holding onto it with one hand , that also helps . 
_t4 		to keep it more stable . 
_t4 		shall we have a civilized breakfast together ? 
_t4 		that would be nice . 
_t4 		what do you think , Naima Boo ? 
_t4 		do you wanna have breakfast together ? 

_t4 		yes ?
_t4 
_t4 		oh you want me back here ?
_t4 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		how 'bout [: about] if we stabilize it by putting it on that ? 
_t4 		it'll help .
_t4 
_t4 		you don't think so ? 
_t4 		I'm stabilizing it .
_t4 
_t4 		all+right , all+right .
_t4 
_t4 		you hold it . 
_t4 		you know to make something more stable it will help if you +...
_t4 
_t4 		&aw .
_t4 
_t4 		see . 
_t4 		put the wider ones on the bottom and the narrow ones on the top .
_t4 
_t4 		there (.) there .
_t4 
_t4 		see , it's more stable , look at how stable that is now .
_t4 
_t4 		and the other thing is it's hard to make things stable on (.) carpet like this .
_t4 
_t4 		'cause [: because] it's sort of uneven . 
_t4 		things would be more stable on that floor which is much more flat . 
_t4 		see , this is an uneven floor . 
_t4 		well I meant this kind of +//. 
_t4 		this part of the floor in the kitchen is more stable .
_t4 
_t4 		we'll put this up here . 
_t4 		what's who gonna try and do ? 
_t4 		I'm gonna (.) peel the kiwi now . 
_t4 		mmmm .
_t4

_t4 		hey , Mommy !
_t4 
_t4 		oh I see , that's a really tall tower . 
_t4 		ya:y ! 

_t4 		I've been using it in my cereal when I have cereal . 

_t4 		there's [: there is] some stems in here , baby+oh so ,  , we can get rid of the stems if you like . 
_t4 		and that green one you don't want to eat though .
_t4 
_t4 		that's not ripe . 
_t4 		but you can eat the rest . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm , well all you really need to do is take the stems off . 
_t4 		you pinch the stems off like that . 
_t4 		and then you can eat the berries . 
_t4 		and that way you have more berries to eat !
_t4 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		you don't want to throw away the berries .
_t4 
_t4 		oh , you don't want to throw away good berries when you could eat them . 
_t4 		that would be a waste of good blueberries . 
_t4 		especially the:se blueberries , which are delicious . 
_t4 		we should ,  +/.
_t4 
_t4 		I wonder if a little boy or a little girl picked these blueberries .
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm , I think it was a little boy who put them out . 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		I saw a little boy putting them out . 
_t4 		uh+oh . 
_t4 		we bought them on the road , Naima . 

_t4 		
_t4 		I guess , but I'm gonna put it in the fridge now . 
_t4 		um , what was I thinking +//? 
_t4 		oh , we should ,  +...
_t4 
_t4 		we should try to visit the organic blueberry farm down the road . 
_t4 		is it on +//? 
_t4 		it is on the way to Cobb's Cook isn't it ?
_t4 
_t4 		uh , no . 

_t4 
_t4 		it's on the way to Machaias . 
_t4 		oh , that's right .
_t4 
_t4 		and give them a little heads+up . 
_t4 		if we're gonna do that . 
_t4 		maybe we should . 
_t4 		I think we should call Gramps' . 
_t4 		it's a working day , Tuesday . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		so +... 
_t4 		the only issues are whether Grandma's [: Grandma is] going on a cross+country trip again . 
_t4 		I wonder if he's +/.
_t4 
_t4 		well , and I wonder if they're at the Blue Hill Fair . 
_t4 		oh . 
_t4 		marketing or anything . 
_t4 		I suppose so . 
_t4 		we can give 'em [: them] a call . 
_t4 		which starts tonight actually , as far as I can tell . 
_t4 		well +... 
_t4 		so +... 
_t4 		well if the weather's [: weather is] as good maybe we should take the trip . 
_t4 		the proble(m) +... 
_t4 		Sunday . 
_t4 		to ? 
_t4 		Blue Hill Fair , from +... 
_t4 		oh , y'know [: you know] it would make a lot mo:re sense to get the blueberries except we'll have_to buy +//. 
_t4 		keep buying ice .
_t4 
_t4 		from  .
_t4 
_t4 		and pick it up there .
_t4 
_t4 		no , I really would prefer Tuesday . 
_t4 		but +/.
_t4 
_t4 		'cause [: because] Gramps' Farm is out of the way . 
_t4 		but we're not +/.
_t4 
_t4 		I know .
_t4 
_t4 		compared to Blue Hill . 
_t4 		I mean +/. 
_t4 		well , they're both +//.
_t4 
_t4 		I mean +...
_t4 
_t4 		Gramps' Farm is less out of the way than the Blue Hill Fair is . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		uh , yeah but I think that trip to the Blue Hill Fair would be ,  +... 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		good for other reasons .
_t4 
_t4 		right , but I'm just saying , in terms of (.) the tradeoff of several days of icing .
_t4 
_t4 		and icebox versus taking the side+trip to Gramps' Farm on the way home , I'd prefer to take the side+trip to Gramps' Farm . 
_t4 		oh , it's not the +/.
_t4 
_t4 		yeah , well , it does +//.
_t4 
_t4 		it's still a problem in terms of the timing of the trip .
_t4 
_t4 		why ? 
_t4 		'cause [: because] we're gonna be under a lot of pressure to get +... 
_t4 		I know , but +... 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		is that a reasonable stop ? 
_t4 		that's a very reasonable stop , in fact it's almost an ideal stop , it's about an hour and a half . 
_t4 		okay , well +... 
_t4 		actually maybe not  . 
_t4 		maybe an hour , but still +... 
_t4 		is that a good breakfast , Naima ? 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		how is that jam ? 
_t4 		I haven't had any . 
_t4 		it's good . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		not overly sweet . 
_t4 		xxx we could read that after breakfast . 
_t4 		well , I'm not gonna read it 'cause [: because] I'm eating my breakfast . 
_t4 		and I'm gonna eat some cereal now so I +//. 
_t4 		I'm not gonna read it .
_t4 
_t4 		we'll read it to you as s(oon) +//. 

_t4 		why does the moth(er) +//.
_t4 
_t4 		her mother want to pick blueberries ?
_t4 
_t4 		that's right . 
_t4 		her mother wants to can blueberries for next winter . 
_t4 		that means +... 
_t4 		I know it probably sounds like it means put them in cans but it means put them in jars . 
_t4 		like to make jam . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		on the stove , and put it in jars , and then store it , keep it , so that they will have blueberries all year round . 
_t4 		we do that too except we put the blueberries in the freezer . 
_t4 		so we have them all year round . 
_t4 		almost all year round . 
_t4 		so Naima gets to eat frozen blueberries . 
_t4 		all year round . 
_t4 		this is the time of year when people who have blueberry fields pick their blueberries . 
_t4 		in fact , that's probably a reason why they aren't at the Blue Hill Fair , because , 'cause [: because] , it's probably peak time for picking . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		or maybe +... 
_t4 		oh , little Sal finds mother crow and her children ? 

_t4 		huh . 
_t4 		it's a little hard to do it if +//. 
_t4 		just one person .
_t4 
_t4 		you would like to hike on your own just walking , wouldn't you ? 
_t4 		and if you wear sneakers , then you'll have more traction and you won't slip . 
_t4 		mmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		like you did yesterday . 
_t4 		when we were hiking , and you had sandals on . 

_t4 		is something in your mouth ? 

_t4 		mmmm , I like that honey . 

_t4 		no , but , I like +/. 
_t4 		oh , but it is nice , it has a nice flavor .
_t4 
_t4 		
_t4 		I also like the texture 'cause [: because] it's semi+crystallized . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		yep [: yes] . 
_t4 		
_t4 		
_t4 		you can't really get it on the Cape . 
_t4 		mmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		we could maybe get a bigger thing , or (.) some more . 
_t4 		in Eastport ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		but , there must be +... 
_t4 		y'know [: you know] . 
_t4 		
_t4 		what did you say Naima about Blueberries For Sal ? 
_t4 		oh . 
_t4 		ka+plink , ka+plank , ker+plunk . 
_t4 		what's that ? 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		then there was mother bear , and little bear , walking along .
_t4 
_t4 		they were munching ,  . 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		munching berries and swallowing them  . 
_t4 		getting fat for the winter . 
_t4 		xxx  .
_t4 
_t4 		'cause [: because] bears sleep the whole winter . 
_t4 		did you know that ?
_t4 
_t4 		they sleep the who:le winter . 
_t4 		and so they need to eat a lo:t of food before they go to sleep , just like you need to eat a lo:t of (.) food at supper+time so (.) you'll have lots_of food in your tummy when you go to sleep so you could sleep all night . 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		bears sleep all winter . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		they sleep for days and days and +/.
_t4 
_t4 		they sleep all winter because +... 
_t4 		they get tired . 
_t4 		that's a good question .
_t4 
_t4 		well , 'cause [: because] they're tired I guess . 
_t4 		'cause [: because] they (.) wouldn't have much to do all winter so +... 
_t4 		they don't like to waste any time . 
_t4 		they sleep . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		that's a good question . 
_t4 		I think because she heard him outside when he was going  . 
_t4 		and that +//.
_t4 
_t4 		she was lying in bed .
_t4 
_t4 		when she heard that sound outside her window . 
_t4 		so she realized that she'd better do something or else she's not gonna sleep all night 'cause [: because] she'll be listening to the bear going  . 
_t4 		that bear had a bad tooth+ache . 
_t4 		I guess he didn't brush his teeth regularly . 
_t4 		that's why . 
_t4 		so she invited him in 'cause [: because] she wanted to help him so that he wouldn't have a tooth+ache so he wouldn't be making so much noise all night so she: could go to sleep . 
_t4 		I think that's really why she helped him . 
_t4 		and maybe she helped him because she didn't like hearing him suffer and be so miserable . 
_t4 		maybe she wanted to make him feel better just so he would feel better . 
_t4 		well you know , like Daddy said , you could pinch the stem off like tha:t and then you could eat the berry ! 
_t4 		yes . 
_t4 		did y(ou) +//. 
_t4 		are you eating yogurt too , or just blueberries ?
_t4 
_t4 		yogu(rt) +//.
_t4 
_t4 		I haven't seen you eat any yogurt .

_t4 
_t4 		you have ? 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		whatever you say . 
_t4 		why don't you take another bite of yogurt ? 

_t4 		really ?
_t4 
_t4 		well , it's a closed privacy  .
_t4 
_t4 		yes , Boo .
_t4 
_t4 		I: think the tooth was aching 'cause [: because] maybe he had ca:vity and maybe he didn't brush his teeth regularly . 
_t4 		maybe he ate too much honey . 
_t4 		maybe the bear ate +//. 
_t4 		hey , Naima !
_t4 
_t4 		Naima ! 
_t4 		I said +//. 
_t4 		yeah , you know you're not supposed to do that .
_t4 
_t4 		you're making a mess . 
_t4 		and (.) that is gonna cause (.) blueberry stains all over the table that Mommy and Daddy are gonna have_to clean it up . 
_t4 		y'know [: you know] as you get a little bit older you're gonna [: going to] have_to start cleaning up you own mess . 
_t4 		and then you'll be busy . 
_t4 		you'll be very busy . 
_t4 		unless you be +//. 

_t4 		you're gonna be cleaning up your mess all day lo:ng ! 
_t4 		no ?
_t4 
_t4 		the bear drinks out of a big glass ? 
_t4 		does he drink out of a big glass ? 
_t4 		I didn't see that . 
_t4 		oh , you mean if he had cavities ? 
_t4 		well I think if he had cavities it was because he ate too much +//. 
_t4 		maybe too much honey .
_t4 
_t4 		too many +/.
_t4 
_t4 		oh , maybe he ate too m(uch) +/.
_t4 
_t4 		too much salmon ,  boy . 
_t4 		they do , okay . 
_t4 		I didn't know that .
_t4 
_t4 		o:h , d'you [: do you] think his mommy was giving him bear+food like your mommy gives you bear+food ? 
_t4 		o:h . 
_t4 		and too much salmon so he got cavities . 
_t4 		actually , Naima , I think it might have been from too: much honey . 
_t4 		not too much salmon . 
_t4 		well because sweet things are a little worse for your teeth . 
_t4 		but actually blueberries might be okay . 
_t4 		I wouldn't be surprised if blueberries had things that are good for your teeth in them . 
_t4 		polyphenols of various kinds . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		in fact , I'm sure someone's [: someone is] gonna have to look into the  +... 

_t4 		he had just come to the bridge . 
_t4 		and he was not looking where he was going . 
_t4 		well he was supposed to be going over a bridge I think , but he was not looking where he was going . 

_t4 		he tripped over something . 
_t4 		I don't think we know . 
_t4 		bother , said Pooh , as it floated under the bridge . 
_t4 		he looked at the river as it slipped slowly away beneath him . 
_t4 		and suddenly , there was his fir cone , slipping away too . 
_t4 		that's funny , said Pooh . 
_t4 		I dropped it on the other side and it came out on this side . 
_t4 		I wonder if it would do it again . 
_t4 		and he went back for more fir cones . 
_t4 		it did . 
_t4 		it kept on doing it . 
_t4 		then he dropped two: in at once and leaned over the bridge to see which of them would come out first . 
_t4 		and one of them did . 
_t4 		but as they were both the same size , Pooh didn't know if it was the one he wanted to win , or the other one . 
_t4 		so the next time he dropped in one big one and one little one . 
_t4 		the big one came out first . 
_t4 		which is what he had said it would do . 
_t4 		and the little one came out last , which was what he had said it would do . 
_t4 		so he had won twice . 
_t4 		and when he went home for tea , he had won thirty+six and lost twenty+eight . 
_t4 		which meant that he was +...
_t4 
_t4 		well +...
_t4 
_t4 		I guess twenty+eight times he got it wrong and thirty+six times he got it right . 
_t4 		which meant that he was +... 
_t4 		well , you take twenty+eight from thirty+six and that's what he was .
