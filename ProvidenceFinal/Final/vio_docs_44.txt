_d6791 		Sophie in toy+land look at this book is coming apart . 
_d6791 		Sophie was very sad she couldn't find Peter the panda anywhere . 
_d6791 		he was her favorite toy and she took him to bed every night . 
_d6791 		it was almost bedtime and Sophie didn't know how she'd get to sleep without him . 
_d6791 		Sophie sat on Beauty her rocking+horse and rocked sadly back and forth . 
_d6791 		hey you have a rocking+horse like that . 
_d6791 		what's yours called ? 
_d6791 		xxx . 
_d6791 		as her eyes filled with tears something she didn't know what made her rock faster than ever before she closed her eyes there was a tremendous whistling in her ears . 
_d6791 		the next minute she was tumbling head over heels through the air then floating gently down to land on something soft . 
_d6791 		Sophie blinked her eyes . 
_d6791 		where was she exactly ? 
_d6791 		hello Sophie growled a voice from above her head she opened her eyes and looked up . 
_d6791 		the legs of a bed her bed towered above her it must have grown . 
_d6791 		peaking over the edge of her quilt was big Ted next to him was little Ted . 
_d6791 		see them ? 
_d6791 		hello Sophie squeaked little Ted . 
_d6791 		her teddy bears were talking she looked around she was tiny . 
_d6791 		help she gulped I'm tiny I've shrunk her eyes filled with tears . 
_d6791 		hello Sophie welcome to toy+land called a voice from across the room . 
_d6791 		can you point to where you think Samantha Sophie's doll is ? 
_d6791 		right . 
_d6791 		you're as tall as I am gasped Sophie . 
_d6791 		I'm no bigger than my own doll what's going on ? 
_d6791 		don't cry said Samantha gently you're in toy+land that's all . 
_d6791 		we're all little here you'll grow big when Beauty takes you home again . 
_d6791 		Sophie turned her head . 
_d6791 		Beauty now tiny just like her was on the floor beside her . 
_d6791 		how come Beauty got small too ? 
_d6791 		(be)cause +... 
_d6791 		xxx let's let Violet answer .
_d6791 
_d6791 		even the toy shrank ? 

_d6791 		no it's because that's a big toy . 
_d6791 		look out below cried big Ted we're coming down squeaked little Ted . 
_d6791 		big Ted tied one end of a cord to the bed and dropped the other end to the floor it was the sash of Sophie's bathrobe the bears climbed down it . 
_d6791 		let's call the other toys suggested Samantha wake up everybody she cried . 
_d6791 		suddenly all of Sophie's toys sprang to life . 
_d6791 		Sophie's tiniest dolls dashed out of the dollhouse and the toys that had been put into the toy+box jumped down from it . 
_d6791 		let's play suggested big Ted . 
_d6791 		this is fun said Sophie . 
_d6791 		as she played games with her toys would you like to do that Violet ? 
_d6791 		oh yeah . 
_d6791 		is that how she's gonna get her panda ? 
_d6791 		where's +//.
_d6791 
_d6791 		oh yeah I don't know . 
_d6791 		where's Peter asked Sophie suddenly . 
_d6791 		they looked everywhere but Peter the panda was no where to be found . 
_d6791 		they gazed at each other in dismay then Sophie heard a soft noise . 
_d6791 		everyone stood still and listened . 
_d6791 		someone's calling said the fairy doll who had very good hearing . 
_d6791 		it's coming from the top of the bookcase said Sophie . 
_d6791 		they crowded beneath the bookcase a tiny black and white head appeared over the top high above them it was Peter the panda . 
_d6791 		I'm stuck he squeaked in a tiny voice . 
_d6791 		gosh said Sophie I must have put you there when I was told to straighten up my room . 
_d6791 		please get me down begged Peter the panda but how asked Sophie . 
_d6791 		the bookcase is so high and we're so little . 
_d6791 		what can they do Violet ? 
_d6791 		you know what I think they should do ? 
_d6791 		I think she should go back on her horse and get big again and then she can just walk right over to it and pick it up right ? 
_d6791 		I know a way said big Ted he ran off and came back pushing Sophie's toy fire engine we can use this what a good idea . 
_d6791 		it stretched higher and higher into the air just the way a real fire engine's ladder does until the very top of it was resting against the bookcase . 
_d6791 		now climb down Peter shouted Samantha . 
_d6791 		oh no I can't said Peter don't worry said big Ted I'll get him down . 
_d6791 		he climbed up the ladder and lifted Peter onto his shoulders . 
_d6791 		everybody cheered and clapped when big Ted carried Peter safely to the ground . 
_d6791 		thank you said Sophie hugging big Ted and kissing his cheek . 
_d6791 		just then the clock on the bedroom wall went cuckoo [x 
_d6791 		uh+oh said Sophie it's time for bed I have_to go . 
_d6791 		bye bye toys thank you . 
_d6791 		goodbye shouted the toys . 
_d6791 		please come again . 
_d6791 		Sophie climbed onto the back of the magic rocking horse and began to rock . 
_d6791 		in an instant she was back in her bedroom a big girl again . 
_d6791 		big Ted and little Ted were slumped at the foot of the bed . 
_d6791 		the fire+engine with Samantha the doll leaning against it was down on the floor . 
_d6791 		the rest of the toys were all back in their normal places . 
_d6791 		it seemed as though Sophie's adventure in toy+land never happened . 
_d6791 		the sash of her bathrobe was still dangling down the side of the bed and Peter the panda was lying safe on Sophie's pillow . 
_d6791 		lucky Sophie had been to toy+land she had a delightful adventure with all her toys and she had found Peter and panda too . 
_d6791 		now she couldn't wait to go to bed . 
_d6791 		Peter and panda  .
_d6791 
_d6791 		Peter the panda . 
_d6791 		she couldn't wait to go to bed and dream about her wonderful adventure . 
_d6791 		hey I think it was a dream do you ? 
_d6791 		do you think it was a dream  ?
_d6791 
_d6791 		and she woke up and she had her she had her bear with her .
_d6791

_d6791 
_d6792 		xxx maybe it's just a  . 
_d6792 		(be)cause I wanted to do a puzzle with Violet Violet you wanna [: want to] do the dinosaur floor puzzle with me while Max does his Legos for a few minutes ?
_d6792 
_d6792 		xxx .
_d6792 
_d6792 		unicorn one .
_d6792 
_d6792 		okay . 
_d6792 		the spring unicorn ?
_d6792 
_d6792 		okay then that's it (be)cause these are long ones .
_d6792 
_d6792 		(o)kay ? 
_d6792 		the people of Feria are always happy for the summers are long the falls are beautiful the springs are a joy and the winters although a little cold are short . 
_d6792 		so they rarely work and instead spend their days playing having parties making music and telling each other wonderful stories . 
_d6792 		hey I wanna go there do you ? 
_d6792 		what are  ? 
_d6792 		mhm . 
_d6792 		some people might say that they are lazy but they wouldn't care because they're just so happy . 
_d6792 		but one year it wasn't like that . 
_d6792 		that year in fact the people of Feria were far from happy indeed they were very worried . 
_d6792 		for although spring should have arrived weeks before it hadn't none of the winter snows were gone yet . 
_d6792 		and lakes had not thawed the birds were not building their nests and the buds of the flowers in the mountain meadows had had failed to open . 
_d6792 		not good enough said the king something must be done . 
_d6792 		which one you think's [: think is] the king Vi(olet) ? 
_d6792 		let Violet choose please Maxwell . 
_d6792 		which one do you think Vi(olet) ? 
_d6792 		the same as he said ? 
_d6792 		I was gonna guess that guy . 
_d6792 		(be)cause you know why ? 
_d6792 		he looks older and he was the one talking but then when Max pointed to that one I think he's right because that one has the crown on . 
_d6792 		right ? 
_d6792 		but it's funny the king's [: king is] usually old isn't he ? 
_d6792 		all the men and women of great council except for one shook their heads for they did not know the answer but the oldest and wisest member stood up .
_d6792 
_d6792 		it is because the spring unicorn the bringer of spring has not visited Feria this year he explained without his arrival there can be no spring . 
_d6792 		the king and the other members of the council looked at each other and frowned but why has the spring unicorn not come to Feria asked the king . 
_d6792 		doesn't he like us anymore ? 
_d6792 		I think it could be because we are so busy enjoying ourselves that we never thank the spring unicorn for all he does for us it could be that he thinks we are lazy and don't deserve to live in such a wonderful place suggested the wisest council member . 
_d6792 		but we must pay that put that right at once said the king all the people in the land must leave the warmth of their homes and go out and start work immediately . 
_d6792 		they must start  they must  . 
_d6792 		the king wanted to describe the sorts of things that people should be doing when they went out to work but the trouble was he knew nothing about work so he didn't know what to say . 
_d6792 		finally he said they &er they must you know they must bustle about being busy doing work and things . 
_d6792 		do you know what a work thing is Violet ? 
_d6792 		sweeping is one kind of work do you know any other kind of work ?
_d6792 
_d6792 		xxx .
_d6792 
_d6792 		in the winter yeah that's a type of work in the winter . 
_d6792 		digging too yep [: yes] so because the king told them to the people of Feria went to work at first they didn't even know what to do . 
_d6792 		then when they looked up the word in the Feria dictionary and they found out what was involved they didn't like the sound of it and grumbled a lot among themselves . 
_d6792 		but as time passed they discovered that they actually enjoyed being busy they shoveled the snow from the paths in their gardens they cleared snow from the roads +... 
_d6792 		they repaired leaking roofs and they even filled all the holes in the road . 
_d6792 		and they still laughed and sang the way they used to before the spring failed to arrive and the king ordered them all to go to work . 
_d6792 		but it still kept snowing and the lakes didn't thaw and the birds failed to build their nests and the flowers didn't bloom . 
_d6792 		what can be the matter now the king asked the oldest and wisest member of his council . 
_d6792 		perhaps the spring unicorn doesn't know how hard we are working said the wise man . 
_d6792 		well the spring unicorn must be told snapped the king stamping his royal feet . 
_d6792 		that very day messengers were sent throughout the land to put up posters announcing that anyone who found the spring unicorn and explained how hard the Ferians had been working would receive all the gold they could wish for . 
_d6792 		the problem was that nobody knew where the spring unicorn lived . 
_d6792 		do you know where he lives Violet ? 
_d6792 		and where's that ? 
_d6792 		what do you call that place you think ? 
_d6792 		he lives in the same place ? 
_d6792 		how come they couldn't find him then ? 
_d6792 		oh they didn't see him ? 
_d6792 		he lives in the valley .
_d6792 
_d6792 		the problem was that nobody knew where the spring unicorn lived . 
_d6792 		nobody that was except for a poor musician who was known as the Whistler . 
_d6792 		I'm fed up with winter and I've got nothing to better to do so I might just as well go and look for the spring unicorn thought the Whistler . 
_d6792 		see him here ? 
_d6792 		so he picked up his flute and set off in search of the spring unicorn he traveled far and wide playing his flute to keep him cheerful on his journey . 
_d6792 		and as he played the notes of the flute danced before him leading him on and on across the widest ocean over the highest mountains . 
_d6792 		I shall follow the notes of my music wherever they lead me he told himself at long last he came to a valley . 
_d6792 		hey Max you're right ! 
_d6792 		where no one had ever been before it was the home of the spring unicorn you have no place here boomed a loud voice how how did you a mere Ferian find your way here ? 
_d6792 		I played my flute and followed the notes explained the Whistler . 
_d6792 		then he demonstrated with a quick tune . 
_d6792 		his music was so beautiful that within minutes a whole herd of magical unicorns appeared and danced before him . 
_d6792 		when he had finally laid down his flute one of the unicorns trotted forward he introduced himself as the spring unicorn . 
_d6792 		why are you here the spring unicorn asked . 
_d6792 		because you failed to come to Feria this year . 
_d6792 		ha exclaimed the spring unicorn I couldn't be bothered to come because the people of Feria are so lazy they do not deserve my beautiful springs . 
_d6792 		but what you say is no longer true why not Vi(olet) ? 
_d6792 		are the people lazy there ?
_d6792 
_d6792 		why not ? 
_d6792 		now they are right ? 
_d6792 		we are no longer lazy and we still have time to be happy telling each other wonderful tales and playing beautiful music . 
_d6792 		maybe you are right said the spring unicorn when the tune had come to an end I'll tell you what I'll do . 
_d6792 		providing you play your beautiful music on your journey back to Feria I shall accompany you . 
_d6792 		and we shall see if the people are no longer lazy . 
_d6792 		can I fly on your back asked the Whistler hopefully ? 
_d6792 		no said the spring unicorn if we fly the journey will be over too quickly and I won't have time to listen to all that music I want you to play . 
_d6792 		we shall walk back the way you came . 
_d6792 		oh drat thought the Whistler but how do they walk across the ocean ? 
_d6792 		xxx the Whistler returned the way he had come and through his journey he played the most beautiful music . 
_d6792 		that the spring unicorn followed every step of the way . 
