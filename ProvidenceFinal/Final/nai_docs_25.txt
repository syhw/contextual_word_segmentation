_d5040 		Gumga ? 
_d5040 		Mommy's +...

_d5040 		we need to put them in something . 
_d5040 		we need a bag to put them in . 
_d5040 		can we use the plastic bag that were using to play store with ? 
_d5040 		the shopping bag ? 
_d5040 		can you get that bag ? 
_d5040 		out of the living room .

_d5040 		it is a potty . 
_d5040 		it's a little potty . 
_d5040 		just , it's a little bit smaller than your potty . 
_d5040 		can you sit on it and tell me if it fits you ? 
_d5040 		very nice . 
_d5040 		does that fit ? 
_d5040 		I was thinking maybe we could use this potty in the car . 
_d5040 		sometimes . 
_d5040 		well no , I don't want those to go in there . 
_d5040 		we can , you know what little later you can help me put them all in a bag . 
_d5040 		there's something else in here for you too . 
_d5040 		why don't you put those back . 
_d5040 		and we'll see what else is in here for you besides the little +... 
_d5040 		would you call this orange or yellow ? 
_d5040 		yeah , I think it's probably yellow . 
_d5040 		it's sort of +... 
_d5040 		you know what , these are just used +... 
_d5040 		these are called foam +... 
_d5040 		what are these called ?

_d5040 		oh , big kid pants . 
_d5040 		see +...
_d5040 		they're sort of like diapers . 
_d5040 		but you'll be able to put take them off and put them on by yourself . 
_d5040 		oh and they're soft inside .

_d5040 		I think we'll wash these and you can try using them . 
_d5040 		this is very different than a diaper . 
_d5040 		(be)cause you can pull them on and pull them off .

_d5041 		a new bunny potty . 
_d5041 		it's very small , isn't it ? 
_d5041 		wow , look at your feet go . 
_d5042 		Mommy's making a tape of Naima .

_d5042 		and I need to take the scissors off the floor , oh+goodness . 
_d5042 		do you want to go , let's see +... 
_d5042 		well , would you like to go to the play+ground first before it rains ?

_d5046 		the black and white sock . 
_d5046 		you're very good at hanging the socks up . 
_d5046 		I think you did it very carefully . 
_d5046 		you wanna hang up the other sock ? 
_d5046 		that one's the matching sock actually . 
_d5047 		yes . 
_d5047 		you're doing a very nice job . 
_d5047 		there's lots more socks there . 
_d5047 		oh this one fell down a little bit , that's okay . 
_d5047 		umm , here I think . 
_d5047 		you can probably figure out which ones are matching . 
_d5047 		this one , this shirt I need to +... 
_d5047 		yeah .
_d5048 		that's a matching sock , isn't it ? 
_d5048 		and that orange one matches . 
_d5048 		can you reach it ? 
_d5048 		you can what ? 
_d5048 		it was in the bath+tub , yeah .

_d5048 		that did fall down . 
_d5048 		what yellow things ? 
_d5048 		oh , those are little +... 
_d5048 		looks like they used to be little plastic butter+flies . 
_d5048 		that are glued to the bath+tub so that +... 
_d5048 		no , so that a person taking a shower won't slip . 
_d5048 		it's okay , they're just plastic . 
_d5048 		yes honey . 
_d5048 		are you scared ? 
_d5048 		just give me a nice , big hug . 
_d5048 		why are you scared ?

_d5048 		do you hear that ? 
_d5048 		good . 
_d5048 		the camera is making noise , but I also heard the church bell . 
_d5048 		I think it stopped already . 
_d5048 		that's the camera . 
_d5048 		let's hurry up and hang those things up so that we can go to the play+ground . 
_d5048 		we need to hang them up first .

_d5048 		by the way . 
_d5048 		okay .
_d5048 		I will hold you and hang up my laundry . 
_d5048 		but , I would like you to know that there's nothing to be scared of with that piece of plastic . 
_d5048 		I'm not doing anything to it . 
_d5048 		it doesn't matter . 
_d5048 		nothing needs to be done with it . 
_d5048 		nothing at all . 
_d5048 		yeah , plastic butterflies . 
_d5048 		that's what they're for . 
_d5048 		but you know what , we don't even use this bath+tub . 
_d5048 		we don't even take showers in it . 
_d5048 		do we ? 
_d5048 		we just use it to hang clothes . 
_d5048 		right ? 
_d5048 		you wanna touch the +... 
_d5048 		plastic butterfly . 
_d5048 		wanna touch it ? 
_d5048 		want Mommy to touch it ? 
_d5048 		okay .
_d5048 		Mommy will touch it . 
_d5048 		yeah , I'm rubbing it . 
_d5048 		it's flat . 
_d5048 		it's almost like a piece of paper . 
_d5048 		here actually you know what , it peels right off . 
_d5048 		this is it . 
_d5048 		the plastic . 
_d5048 		we could throw them in the garbage . 
_d5048 		see , it's plastic . 
_d5048 		should I see if I can get the other one off ? 
_d5048 		you're standing on me . 
_d5048 		let's see if I can get , peel the other one off too . 
_d5048 		we don't really need to have them in here . 
_d5048 		careful , boo . 
_d5048 		this one is harder to get off . 
_d5048 		do you want to  .
_d5048 		next to the toilet ? 
_d5048 		you know that garbage and you lift up the lid and put the butterfly in the garbage . 
_d5048 		yeah .
_d5048 		yeah , we took it off and we +...
_d5048 		put it in the and you , Naima , put it in the garbage . 
_d5048 		well I tried to peel that one off , I had a little trouble . 
_d5048 		(be)cause it's kinda [: kind of] stuck . 
_d5048 		I'm not gonna do it right now , right now what I want to do is finish hanging up the laundry . 
_d5048 		you are .
_d5048 		you smell very nice . 
_d5048 		you were , but then you touched it and you put it in the garbage . 
_d5048 		you're not scared of that anymore , I don't think so . 
_d5048 		yeah you know what , I think that might be paint from something that you painted that was drying there . 
_d5048 		I think that's what that is . 
_d5048 		here's another sock you could hang up . 
_d5048 		this is , no actually +... 
_d5048 		(be)cause this is gray and that's black . 
_d5048 		you're gonna need to look here . 
_d5048 		try to find a gray sock that matches . 
_d5048 		I don't know if it +... 
_d5048 		it might not even be here . 
_d5048 		let's see , where's the matching one ? 
_d5048 		lalie , lalie , nursie ? 
_d5048 		you can hang that up even though we don't have the matching one right now . 
_d5048 		why don't you go and hang that up . 
_d5048 		can I show you something ? 
_d5048 		okay , watch me do it . 
_d5048 		I'm putting it over , but then I'm gonna pull the other side . 
_d5048 		because that way , it won't fall down easily . 
_d5048 		yeah , that's another plastic butterfly . 
_d5048 		there's another sock .
_d5048 		who's sock is that ? 
_d5048 		that's a Daddy sock , yeah . 
_d5048 		(re)member what I said about pulling it ? 
_d5048 		here , I'll get it for you . 
_d5048 		try again , try again . 
_d5048 		try hanging it up again . 
_d5048 		no , use your other hand . 
_d5048 		that's okay . 
_d5048 		(o)kay , put it up there . 
_d5048 		yes and then what you should do is hold onto it and then bring this down so that it hangs like that . 
_d5048 		see that way it'll stay up , it won't fall down that way . 
_d5048 		I'm showing you how to hang up the sock . 
_d5048 		there's another sock . 
_d5048 		try using both hands to make it stay . 
_d5048 		like I showed you . 
_d5048 		where's your other hand ? 
_d5048 		where's your other hand ? 
_d5048 		nope [: no] nope [: no] nope [: no] , lemme [: let me] have this hand .

_d5048 		now , go behind it and find the other end . 
_d5048 		and pull it like that . 
_d5048 		see that way it hangs . 
_d5048 		where's the +... 
_d5048 		where's the sock that matches ? 
_d5048 		whoa . 
_d5048 		are you okay ? 
_d5048 		it looks like a funny little house , doesn't it ? 
_d5048 		mmmm+hmmm , be careful there please .

_d5049 		you want the umbrella to go in the rain . 
_d5049 		well but yes , except that we can't go the play+ground and play . 
_d5049 		with an umbrella . 
_d5049 		(be)cause an umbrella would simply get in the way of playing . 
_d5049 		I think it would . 
_d5049 		oh yeah ? 
_d5049 		it is ? 
_d5050 		let's check and see if it's running , okay ?

_d5060 		what is it ?
_d5060 		it's too tall , see . 
_d5060 		this cover is where it needs to be . 
_d5060 		we could probably find something that would fit in there . 
_d5060 		like you could put your puzzle pieces in there . 
_d5060 		well , I think the ball is a little bit too big . 
_d5060 		let's see what could fit in there .

_d5063 		I see all kinds . 
_d5063 		let's read it together . 
_d5063 		it looks like a lizard .

_d5063 		that flute ? 
_d5063 		oh , there's a very big bird on a tree in that picture . 
_d5063 		what's in that picture ? 
_d5063 		gentle , gentle with the book . 
_d5063 		what's happening ? 
_d5063 		I think that is actually a hyena .

_d5063 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_d5063 		I think it's maybe a lizard .
_d5063 		where's the baby lizard ? 
_d5063 		oh .
_d5063 		they don't nurse , that's true . 
_d5063 		yes , squirrels do nurse .
_d5063 		yeah . 
_d5063 		these squirrels do have nursies . 
_d5063 		what other kinds of animals have , are mammals ? 
_d5063 		that's right Naima , fish don't . 
_d5063 		that does look like it could be a baby lizard . 
_d5063 		this is a drawing , somebody drew that picture . 
_d5063 		and that looks like a spider on top . 
_d5063 		I don't think spiders nurse . 
_d5063 		they do hatch out of eggs . 
_d5063 		they do . 
_d5063 		is the name  or  ? 
_d5063 		she wrote her name . 
_d5063 		she did write her name . 
_d5063 		peeking out of a cave . 
_d5063 		that's actually a hare . 
_d5063 		peeking out of a cave . 
_d5063 		oh , what is the hare doing with the man ? 
_d5063 		it looks like the hare is listening to the man saying something . 
_d5064 		huh ? 
_d5064 		he looks like he's listening to me . 
_d5064 		who's saying come here ? 
_d5064 		the man ? 
_d5064 		she's saying come here , hare . 
_d5064 		hares do nurse , hares are just like rabbits , they do nurse , they're mammals .

_d5064 		tu+la+log ? 
_d5064 		okay .
_d5064 		oh , it looks a little bit like a centipede . 
_d5064 		I think it's actually a snake . 
_d5064 		now I think that snake is reading these words . 
_d5064 		there's no name . 
_d5064 		yeah , you do . 
_d5064 		that's a horse made out of wood . 
_d5064 		maybe the bear will wear them . 
_d5064 		oh , the bear's gonna go to the South Harmouth library ?
_d5064 		his own South Harmouth library ? 
_d5064 		you think where he lives there's a South Harmouth library ? 
_d5064 		this bear ? 
_d5064 		and I bet his Mommy says , you can't go to the library unless you put your socks and shoes on . 
_d5064 		his Mommy is the dog ? 
_d5064 		I think the bears Mommy would be a bear , don't you think ? 
_d5064 		a bigger bear , yeah . 
_d5064 		that's like an old+fashioned bowling set . 
_d5064 		those are +...

_d5065 		you were digging in the dirt today , weren't you ?

_d5065 		you were sitting on it , weren't you ? 
_d5065 		did you climb up by yourself ? 
_d5065 		thought so . 
_d5065 		I think Angie might have helped you . 
_d5065 		I used to help you when you were littler , but you can climb up . 
_d5065 		I think so . 
_d5065 		she was putting on her own seatbelt .

_d5065 		the bear will eat the toast ? 
_d5065 		what's this ? 
_d5065 		what does he use the clock for ? 
_d5065 		do you think he knows how to turn it on ? 
_d5065 		probably all by himself . 
_d5065 		mmmm+hmmm .
_d5065 		is it silly looking ? 
_d5065 		Daddy said it was silly looking ? 
_d5065 		those look like two little kitty cats .

_d5067 		I think that's a rooster . 
_d5067 		the reason you can tell it's [: it is] a rooster is it has all this red on its head . 
_d5067 		more than the hens have .
