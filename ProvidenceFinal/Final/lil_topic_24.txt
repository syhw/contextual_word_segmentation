_t4 		Norman . 
_t4 		Norman was a doorman . 
_t4 		he greeted all the art loving creatures .
_t4 
_t4 		she's wearing a dress . 
_t4 		you're right .

_t4 		you're right .

_t4 		we're quite safe said Norman I sprung all the traps .

_t4 
_t4 		a sad clown and a statue you're right . 
_t4 		he handled each masterpiece with as much care and respect as if he had painted it himself . 
_t4 		he would also take great pride in pointing out the artistic features of certain pieces of Greek sculpture . 
_t4 		which rested in the dark corners of the storage room . 
_t4 		she is wearing quite a snazzy dress I think . 
_t4 		as  we missed a page . 
_t4 		Norman's only worry was keeping out of sight of the sharp eyed upstairs guard . 
_t4 		who often came to the basement to set traps for mice . 
_t4 		his bright flashlight frightened the visitors .
_t4 
_t4 		I know they're running away from the guard . 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		as for Norman he always managed to escape . 
_t4 		and hide inside an old armored knights helmet . 
_t4 		up there he felt perfectly safe . 
_t4 		actually the helmet was Norman's home . 
_t4 		which he had made into a very comfortable and workable studio . 
_t4 		just see what a splendid sky light the visor made . 
_t4 		like most everybody Norman had a hobby . 
_t4 		each night after work he tried to create something pleasing or beautiful . 
_t4 		perhaps a painting of swiss cheese and crackers or a statue . 
_t4 		one bitter cold day Norman decided to stay in his studio and make something out of wire . 
_t4 		I know he's making something out of wire . 
_t4 		it's a mouse trap . 
_t4 		he took it apart .
_t4 
_t4 		and he's taking the wire off of it to make a sculpture right ?
_t4 		right .
_t4 
_t4 		he made a trapeze . 
_t4 		that's right . 
_t4 		all through the day and far into the night Norman twisted and bent wires into many strange and mysterious shapes . 
_t4 		until at last he created something he was really proud of . 
_t4 		it looked for all the world like a mouse on a trapeze . 
_t4 		oh yes . 
_t4 		that night when he finally went to sleep he was a tired but happy mouse . 
_t4 		early next morning when Norman went outside to shovel away snow in front of his doorway . 
_t4 		he noticed a man reading a sign nearby . 
_t4 		he read the sign to . 
_t4 		sculpture contest . 
_t4 		open to all artists great and small . 
_t4 		last day today . 
_t4 		back he flew . 
_t4 		why can't I show my wire statue he said . 
_t4 		as he slid through the visor opening . 
_t4 		but what would he call it . 
_t4 		all pieces must have a title he well knew . 
_t4 		suddenly he had an inspiration . 
_t4 		trapeze . 
_t4 		now he had a fitting title for his wire work . 
_t4 		although Norman was a modest mouse he practically burst a button off his coat . 
_t4 		then as this was the last day for artists to bring their sculpture pieces . 
_t4 		Norman put a cover over his statue as he +...
_t4 
_t4 		there the mouse is hiding there under the cover . 
_t4 		up the snowy staircase he climbed . 
_t4 		once inside the huge museum he eagerly followed the other sculptors from one room to another . 
_t4 		he still had to be extremely careful of the guard .
_t4 
_t4 		there's a bust you're right . 
_t4 		the other bust is sad ? 
_t4 		yes . 
_t4 		the accordion right . 
_t4 		you're right . 
_t4 		it's an accordion . 
_t4 		what's this ? 
_t4 		is that a statue of a woman dancing ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		she looks like she's having a good time . 
_t4 		don't you think ? 
_t4 		yes . 
_t4 		and there's a statue of a man riding a horse . 
_t4 		and a statue of a lil [: little] boy and girl holding a balloon . 
_t4 		after carefully removing the cover from his wire statue he left it on the floor with the rest of the contestants work . 
_t4 		out he went into the snowy afternoon knowing he had done his best . 
_t4 		you see he had not forgotten he was a doorman who had a job to do . 
_t4 		she is wearing a dress . 
_t4 		what color is her dress ?
_t4 
_t4 		oh another dress . 
_t4 		wow .
_t4 
_t4 		two dresses what color are they ? 
_t4 		yellow and pink . 
_t4 		meanwhile upstairs in the sculpture gallery of the museum . 
_t4 		the judges were busy judging . 
_t4 		oh ! 
_t4 		there it is . 
_t4 		quietly and seriously they examined each piece . 
_t4 		trying to find which ones deserved prizes . 
_t4 		gradually they found themselves huddled around a certain statue . 
_t4 		now this is an [: and] amazing creation exclaimed one . 
_t4 		there's no name and isn't it a shame it's so tiny . 
_t4 		yes but remember the contest is open to great and small . 
_t4 		one by one each guard when asked if he had knew who had brought it in shook his head and said no not I . 
_t4 		the museum director couldn't understand why none of them had caught sight of the artist . 
_t4 		but when the sharp eyed guard took a closer look he gasped . 
_t4 		so this is where my mouse traps have been going . 
_t4 		I think I know where to start looking for that tricky trap snatcher . 
_t4 		and without waiting another minute the guard snapped on his flash light and hurried downstairs to the basement . 
_t4 		what's this one of my traps stuck in a knights helmet . 
_t4 		he lifted up the visor to investigate . 
_t4 		there inside he saw pieces of wire and parts of traps . 
_t4 		and strangest of all a neat straw bed which could only belong to a mouse . 
_t4 		whoever he is he must be very find of my cheese said the guard . 
_t4 		during all this time Norman had been tending to his duty as a doorman . 
_t4 		a party of mice from the country for whom he had be waiting . 
_t4 		was long passed due . 
_t4 		and he was getting mighty cold and hungry . 
_t4 		but to his surprise who should come around the corner but the sharp eyed guard . 
_t4 		there you are said the guard as Norman flad inside . 
_t4 		but when the guard held a piece of cheese above the hole Norman sniffed it . 
_t4 		and just as he was about to reach up and snatch the cheese a hand came around swiftly and caught Norman by the tail . 
_t4 		are you the rascal who's been taking my mouse traps everyday and using them for artistic purposes asked the guard . 
_t4 		it's just my hobby said Norman . 
_t4 		it's just my hobby . 
_t4 		oh there having a big party . 
_t4 		the guard tossed Norman up on his shoulder . 
_t4 		Norman was sure he was being taken to jail . 
_t4 		you can imagine his surprise when instead they entered the museum and heard the artist all clapping and cheering hooray for trapeze . 
_t4 		hooray for trapeze ! 
_t4 		I do believe you've won a prize . 
_t4 		the guard rushed right up to the judges platform and said proudly . 
_t4 		here's the winner I found him freezing in the snow . 
_t4 		indeed said the head judge . 
_t4 		why yes who else would could have created the daring mouse on the trapeze . 
_t4 		what is your name my good fellow ? 
_t4 		and what would you like for your prize ? 
_t4 		if you please sir my name is Norman . 
_t4 		and I'm the doorman downstairs . 
_t4 		and I've always dreamed of seeing the upstairs of the museum without getting caught . 
_t4 		that's what I'd like best . 
_t4 		there's a bust . 
_t4 		and another bust .
_t4 
_t4 		and that's (.) that's a knight with his armor on . 
_t4 		yes .
_t4 
_t4 		the guard led Norman out into the hall . 
_t4 		where together they began a grand tour of the entire art museum . 
_t4 		later that night when Norman returned from returned to his door . 
_t4 		he found his mice friends from the country waiting for him . 
_t4 		of course Norman invited them in where he shared with them an enormous slice of cheese . 
_t4 		a present given to him from the warm hearted guard . 
_t4 		what a wonderful way to end the day . 
_t4 		good night .

_t4 
_t4 		I know . 
_t4 		I eat it too . 
_t4 		I eat so much tuna . 
_t4 		I know . 
_t4 		I mean I think it's only related to pregnancy .
_t4 
_t4 		and young kids but I guess the mercury will affect brain development . 
_t4 		potentially . 
_t4 		you know they said canned tuna has less than fresh tuna it's really I guess it's tuna and swordfish that your suppose to cut back on .
_t4 
_t4 		but one to two if they're really suggesting one to two ounces a week I can't believe that they don't hand this out on a flyer to people .
_t4 
_t4 		she would literally eat it everyday if she could .
_t4 
_t4 		I know literally the small the tiny can with the flip .
_t4 
_t4 		top that you'll buy for lunch that comes with crackers or whatever .
_t4 
_t4 		that's three ounces and it's like this big tiny . 

_t0 		and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all . 
_t0 		and made him king of all the wild things . 

_t0 		and swinging from the trees . 
_t0 		and marching in a parade .
_t0
