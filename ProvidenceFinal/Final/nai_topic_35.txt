_t4 		what kind of a creature is that ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		yep [: yes] . 
_t4 		now , we can put it together , but you know , we're gonna have_to take it up so the floor can be washed a little later . 
_t4 		should we do it somewhere where we don't have_to pick it up ? 
_t4 		instead ?
_t4 
_t4 		I wonder how big it is . 
_t4 		lemme [: let me] just see .
_t4 
_t4 		finished size , ten+and+a+third by fourteen+and+a+half .
_t4 
_t4 		I wonder if we had a really big board we could use it . 
_t4 		I have an idea .
_t4 
_t4 		I have a tray we could do it in .
_t4 
_t4 		whoop , did that come off ? 
_t4 		here , lemme [: let me] fix it .
_t4 
_t4 		well +... 
_t4 		I'm gonna put it on your bottom . 

_t4 
_t4 		you know what I was thinking ? 
_t4 		I was thinking a little later if you want we could go to Earthly Delights for you second breakfast .

_t4 		would you like that ?
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		really ? 
_t4 		she could come . 
_t4 		that way , we can move it around and take it off the floor when we're done . 
_t4 		see this little tray with the elephants on it ? 
_t4 		I'm gonna go get the tape (.) recorder and bring it in here . 
_t4 		here are all the pieces . 
_t4 		spread them all out and put them all face+up . 
_t4 		lemme [: let me] +//. 
_t4 		I'll be right back , Emma .
_t4 
_t4 		let's [: let us] see . 
_t4 		no , we're gonna do it together . 
_t4 		where's my mic ? 
_t4 		here it is .
_t4 
_t4 		yeah , we'll do it together .
_t4 
_t4 		um , it's plastic actually . 
_t4 		it's plastic .
_t4 
_t4 		all+right , let's [: let us] look at that picture that it's supposed to look like . 
_t4 		like that , okay .
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		mmmm , this looks like kind+of a hard puzzle . 
_t4 		I'm going to .
_t4 
_t4 		let's [: let us] see . 
_t4 		you know what the easiest place to start I think would be ?
_t4 
_t4 		see how there's pink flowers only on the left side of the picture ? 
_t4 		why don't we find all the pieces that have part of the pink flower in them ?
_t4 
_t4 		yeah !
_t4 
_t4 		well put it on the tray . 
_t4 		we're gonna make it on the tray so that we can move it when we're done if we want to .
_t4 
_t4 		here +//. 
_t4 		oh that's a bird .
_t4 
_t4 		there's pink flower .
_t4 
_t4 		here's some pink flower . 
_t4 		here's some too .
_t4 
_t4 		first I'm just finding all the pieces . 
_t4 		up , there's a tiny bit of pink flower in that piece .
_t4 
_t4 		teeny tiny . 
_t4 		this puzzle has sixty pieces ! 
_t4 		hey , you did it ! 
_t4 		you put three of the pink flower pieces together . 
_t4 		well , this needs to be an edge , doesn't it ? 
_t4 		what about this ? 
_t4 		excuse me , your hair and head is right in the way . 
_t4 		I can't see the puzzle at all .
_t4 
_t4 		thank+you . 
_t4 		there . 
_t4 		see , that's that edge . 
_t4 		and here's a bud . 
_t4 		where's this flower bud in the picture ? 
_t4 		is it +//? 
_t4 		oh , it's down there .
_t4 
_t4 		so , I think this is a bottom piece .
_t4 
_t4 		o:h , good .
_t4 
_t4 		that's good . 
_t4 		up , here's another flower piece .
_t4 
_t4 		oh , you made it connect . 
_t4 		this one goes down here because it's this bud .
_t4 
_t4 		there's two birds , so let's [: let us] look for +/.
_t4 
_t4 		let's find all the bird pieces next .
_t4 
_t4 		oops , sorry .
_t4 
_t4 		I just put all the bird pieces in one spot for now .
_t4 
_t4 		uh , sorry . 
_t4 		bird mird ? 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		he:y , we got a lot of pieces together .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		some fruit of some kind . 
_t4 		now , let's [: let us] see . 
_t4 		there's a bird near this petal .
_t4 
_t4 		I think , is it +//? 
_t4 		yeah , this bird must be near this .
_t4 
_t4 		and this bird should have more bird body .
_t4 
_t4 		does this go to this ? 
_t4 		I think this part +... 
_t4 		this is this other bird .
_t4 
_t4 		let's [: let us] find the birds . 
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		I think that goes there . 
_t4 		and this might go here . 
_t4 		I think +...
_t4 
_t4 		I think this piece +//. 
_t4 		I think I found a beak over there .
_t4 
_t4 		see ? 
_t4 		all that piece has is beak . 
_t4 		this is another part of a bird . 
_t4 		do you think it goes here ? 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		I think we could find a corner piece that might +//. 
_t4 		oh wait .
_t4 
_t4 		this is a corner piece that must go up here . 
_t4 		the bird's body is (.) there .
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] see . 
_t4 		hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		let's find other cor(ners) +//. 
_t4 		oh wait , there's a tiny bit of pink flower .
_t4 
_t4 		where is that pink flower ?
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		xxx is it an edge piece or not ?
_t4 
_t4 		does it have one sm(ooth) , one flat side ? 
_t4 		let's [: let us] look at the picture of the cover , on the cover , and see where a piece of bud belongs . 
_t4 		I got that one up here .
_t4 
_t4 		up there ? 
_t4 		oh , you're right .
_t4 
_t4 		and there's fur on it . 
_t4 		he:y . 
_t4 		right there . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		oh here's another edge , I mean corner piece .
_t4 		I wonder if that's the corner piece for the bottom left . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		I think upside down and sideways . 
_t4 		like that ? 
_t4 		and I think (.) this corner piece might go +//. 
_t4 		oh wait , maybe not .
_t4 
_t4 		I think maybe this is the corner piece for this side . 
_t4 		I don't know if it goes there .
_t4 
_t4 		I think we need more fur .
_t4 
_t4 		we need a bottom piece with more fur . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] see . 
_t4 		like that . 
_t4 		xxx bottom piece .
_t4 
_t4 		now see if this corner piece goes . 
_t4 		he:y . 
_t4 		uh+huh ?
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		mmmm , you need some white to match that . 
_t4 		here's a corner piece . 
_t4 		where +//? 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 
_t4 		how bout [: about] up in this part ?
_t4 
_t4 		maybe . 
_t4 		we're still missing one more corner piece . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] find the corner piece .
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		I don't see it .
_t4 
_t4 		wait , this is a corner piece . 
_t4 		this must go here .
_t4 
_t4 		probably missing one edge piece here .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		let's [: let us] see . 
_t4 		hmmm , there's a side piece . 
_t4 		that goes there .
_t4 
_t4 		well , it's [: it has] gotta go right on the edge , doesn't it ? 
_t4 		along that edge I think . 
_t4 		wait a minute . 
_t4 		I think that's a black ear . 
_t4 		I think that goes up here .
_t4 
_t4 		aha . 
_t4 		see look , there's the black ear ?
_t4 
_t4 		so that's the top part . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		feels like we're missing pieces though . 
_t4 		are we sitting on any ?
_t4 
_t4 		oh !
_t4 
_t4 		you were sitting on one piece . 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		I don't know . 
_t4 		oh , it looks like the other +/. 
_t4 		is it the other ear ?
_t4 
_t4 		or part of this ear ? 
_t4 		check here .
_t4 
_t4 		does it fit in to that ? 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		no .
_t4 
_t4 		does this go here ? 
_t4 		it does . 
_t4 		and that goes there .
_t4 
_t4 		the whole top edge is done now .
_t4 
_t4 		Naima , how about if that +//?
_t4 
_t4 		yeah , is it right ? 
_t4 		no .
_t4 
_t4 		it's too loose to fit . 
_t4 		how bout [: about] +..?
_t4 
_t4 		I don't think we have a place to put that one yet . 
_t4 		it looks like an ear . 
_t4 		maybe it's the other +//.
_t4 
_t4 		maybe it goes +...
_t4 
_t4 		look and see how the brown branch connects to the black ear ?
_t4 
_t4 		that's this right here . 
_t4 		o:h . 
_t4 		it does go there . 
_t4 		yes . 
_t4 		I think so ,  .
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_t4 
_t4 		I checked . 
_t4 		I'm not .
_t4 
_t4 		I'll check again if you want me to .
_t4 
_t4 		no , I'm not . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] see here .
_t4 
_t4 		those two go +//. 
_t4 		no , they don't go .
_t4 
_t4 		they look like they go , but they don't .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		no , it doesn't go . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		I don't know . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] find more edge pieces .
_t4 
_t4 		there have_to be at least a few . 
_t4 		this is an edge piece , this is an edge piece , this is an edge piece .
_t4 
_t4 		o:h , a very small amount of pink , uh+huh .
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		that doesn't go . 
_t4 		sometimes you just have_to try a+lot of pieces and see what , what fits . 
_t4 		does that go ? 
_t4 		yeah , I guess it does go . 
_t4 		that's nice , isn't it ? 
_t4 		oh , we still need some edge pieces to be found . 
_t4 		this is another edge piece . 
_t4 		where it goes , I don't know .
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		how bout [: about] there ? 
_t4 		oh , that goes .
_t4 
_t4 		oh I wonder if this now goes here . 
_t4 		ya:y !
_t4 
_t4 		it's starting to look more like the picture , isn't it ? 
_t4 		that doesn't go there .
_t4 
_t4 		I think the  be +/.
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		some black , we need an edge piece that has a little black in it .
_t4 
_t4 		do you s(ee) +/.
_t4 
_t4 		but that didn't look like an edge piece .
_t4 
_t4 		this is an edge piece .
_t4 
_t4 		oh ,  , an ear ? 
_t4 		how about on there ? 
_t4 		will it attach to that ear ?
_t4 
_t4 		I think s(o) +//. 
_t4 		no ?
_t4 
_t4 		are you sure ?
_t4 
_t4 		let's see .
_t4 
_t4 		you were right , it doesn't go there . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		certainly , the first time you do a puzzle is the hardest I think . 
_t4 		do you think so ? 
_t4 		Daddy will be very surprised . 
_t4 		that doesn't go there . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		that goes .
_t4 
_t4 		all that bluish . 
_t4 		I still don't understand what piece goes there , though .
_t4 
_t4 		cause there's a+lot of fur involved . 
_t4 		xxx , that doesn't really go . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		I think we're missing an edge piece that has black in it . 
_t4 		those don't have any edges . 
_t4 		well I hope we weren't missing a piece when it was a new puzzle . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] lift up and look and see if we +... 
_t4 		somehow did we miss some ? 
_t4 		look behind you , where the other box is . 
_t4 		are there any pieces under that ? 
_t4 		guess not . 
_t4 		okay , maybe we're just missing a piece . 
_t4 		well , we could still put together most of it . 
_t4 		even if we're missing +/.
_t4 
_t4 		well I wanna keep going .
_t4 
_t4 		I wanna keep going and see what we can do . 
_t4 		that goes there .
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		where's the picture ?
_t4 
_t4 		maybe this , maybe this connects over here .
_t4 
_t4 		no . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm ? 
_t4 		oh , this goes here .
_t4 
_t4 		I think this goes here . 
_t4 		o:h , is it part of an ear ? 
_t4 		does it go over here ? 
_t4 		it's [: it has] got white . 
_t4 		the white is part of the face of the panda .
_t4 
_t4 		does it ? 
_t4 		mmmm +...
_t4 
_t4 		it's a little bit loose .
_t4 
_t4 		how bout [: about] +/?
_t4 
_t4 		how bout [: about] +/?
_t4 
_t4 		it's a very white part . 
_t4 		but with a little black . 
_t4 		I'm not sure we have a place for that .
_t4 
_t4 		where does the panda have stripes ?
_t4 
_t4 		so that goes somewhere here . 
_t4 		jaw piece . 
_t4 		actually that looks right .
_t4 
_t4 		where's that +/? 
_t4 		oh , that's the nose , where +/.
_t4 
_t4 		see where it gets very very bluish white ?
_t4 
_t4 		that must be the nose . 
_t4 		try over here , Naima . 
_t4 		what about here ?
_t4 
_t4 		oh , no , I guess not . 
_t4 		all+right .
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		we got two ears already . 
_t4 		oh , here's another edge piece . 
_t4 		it's really hard to spot them . 
_t4 		that goes there , I think . 
_t4 		this go here ?
_t4 
_t4 		not really ,  .
_t4 
_t4 		no ,  . 
_t4 		this is +//.
_t4 
_t4 		oh , but this goes here .
_t4 
_t4 		and this goes here . 
_t4 		and we need one more edge piece right there .
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		it must have some white and some black , do you see ? 
_t4 		well , that goes there . 
_t4 		and this goes this way . 
_t4 		I think +...
_t4 
_t4 		uh . 
_t4 		we're getting there , Naima ! 
_t4 		we have more +//. 
_t4 		I think more than half the pieces are put together .
_t4 
_t4 		do you think so ?
_t4 
_t4 		you're right . 
_t4 		and it has to be an edge , too .
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 
_t4 		this is an edge . 
_t4 		try that on the side there .
_t4 
_t4 		okay , that means we've [: we have] done all the edges . 
_t4 		look .
_t4 
_t4 		all four edges .
_t4 
_t4 		that's something .
_t4 
_t4 		at least we did that . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		it's pretty white , isn't it ? 
_t4 		hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		it's like putting the cars down in the right street ?
_t4 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		he:y . 
_t4 		o:h !
_t4 
_t4 		that goes very nicely right there . 
_t4 		something must go there somehow . 
_t4 		hmmm , it must have some sky and it must have some white .
_t4 
_t4 		so the bluish and the white it has to have . 
_t4 		how about that ?
_t4 
_t4 		no ?
_t4 
_t4 		bluish and has to have some white . 
_t4 		oh , and it has to have a tiny bit of black .
_t4 
_t4 		how about this ? 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		how bout [: about] over here , Naima ?
_t4 
_t4 		try it there .
_t4 
_t4 		well , I think +... 
_t4 		well , maybe not .
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		this is not a particularly easy puzzle , is it ?
_t4 
_t4 		I'm gonna try this here .
_t4 
_t4 		how bout [: about] there ? 
_t4 		oh no maybe not cause that's its belly .
_t4 
_t4 		it has to be a place where there's blue sky .
_t4 
_t4 		it might go over here somewhere .
_t4 
_t4 		he:y .
_t4 
_t4 		good job . 
_t4 		I think that goes there . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		Daddy left his tv on downstairs . 

_t4 		mmmm , the oil is hurting the animals .
_t4 
_t4 		sea otters , sea+lions , harbor+seals , and killer+whales swallowed oil . 
_t4 		that's a whale .
_t4 
_t4 		they breathed the poisonous fumes . 
_t4 		these animals got very sick also . 
_t4 		hey , that's a (.) sea+lion I think . 
_t4 		do you remember we saw sea lions ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		because it spilled out of the boat . 
_t4 		oil spills have many causes . 
_t4 		some are accidents . 
_t4 		like a tanker like the exxon+valdez runs aground , or collides with another ship . 
_t4 		that means bumps into another ship .
_t4 
_t4 		workers can make mistakes . 
_t4 		or an under+sea oil well starts to lea(k) , leak . 
_t4 		or a pipe can break . 
_t4 		the oil spreads out . 
_t4 		it floats on top of the water . 
_t4 		experts on oil spills rush to the scene . 
_t4 		they start to clean up the mess .
_t4 
_t4 		the first job is to stop the oil from spreading . 
_t4 		they put a boom around the spill . 
_t4 		the boom is like a collar .
_t4 
_t4 		it keeps the oil in one place . 
_t4 		you see this red thing here ?
_t4 
_t4 		this is the boom . 
_t4 		it's usually made out of different things . 
_t4 		for small spills , the experts may call for a skimmer . 
_t4 		there are several kinds of skimmers . 
_t4 		one type works like a giant vacuum+cleaner .
_t4 
_t4 		it sucks up the oil from the water . 
_t4 		sometimes the oil the skimmer collects can be used again . 
_t4 		for some small spills , experts place special pads on top of the oil . 
_t4 		the pads are like sponges . 
_t4 		they soak up the oil , then they have_to get rid of the soaked up oil . 
_t4 		for larger spills , the experts may set the oil on fire . 
_t4 		clean up crews also use chemicals to get rid of large oil spills . 
_t4 		other chemicals make the oil come together . 
_t4 		the oil forms a layer like a sheet of rubber . 
_t4 		one type of skimmer , I guess this is the skimmer machine , lifts the sheet of oil and oily debris , that means garbage , out of the water . 
_t4 		oh , what kind of animals are these ? 
_t4 		puffins ! 
_t4 		sometimes , the experts decide that no action is the best way to treat an oil spill . 
_t4 		the wind and waves mix the oil and water together . 
_t4 		it is like mixing oil and vinegar to make salad dressing ! 
_t4 		in time , much of the oil disappears . 
_t4 		oil spills are major disasters . 
_t4 		it's a very bad thing that happens , that's what a disaster is .
_t4 
_t4 		slowly , scientists are learning how to clean them up . 
_t4 		they are learning how to prevent spills . 
_t4 		how can we help to prevent oil spills ? 
_t4 		that's a good question . 
_t4 		well , we can use less oil .
_t4 
_t4 		if we use less oil , there will be fewer oil tankers in the oceans . 
_t4 		then the chance of oil spills will not be as great . 
_t4 		one way +//. 
_t4 		I bet you didn't know this , Naima .
_t4 
_t4 		you might be surprised .
_t4 
_t4 		one way to save oil is to use less (.) electricity ! 
_t4 		did you know that oil and electricity are related ? 
_t4 		electricity is often produced by burning oil . 
_t4 		less electricity means less oil and less risk of an oil spill . 
_t4 		because sometimes power plants burn oil to make electricity that comes through the electric lines into our house . 
_t4 		another way to cut oil needs is to use less gasoline , which is made from oil . 
_t4 		gasoline is made from oil . 
_t4 		that means driving smaller cars and staying within the speed limit . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		oh , there's a child who wrote a letter to someone in the government . 
_t4 		and drew pictures of sea animals . 
_t4 		wow , and look at the other books in this series . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] see , this is a stage two book . 
_t4 		this book is called Be A Friend to Trees . 
_t4 		this book is called Dinosaurs Are Different . 
_t4 		this book is called Where Does the Garbage Go . 
_t4 		that would be a good book to get . 
_t4 		that's called The Planets in Our Solar System . 
_t4 		hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		trees are good for the earth and good for people and good for animals . 
_t4 		so you need to be good to trees . 
_t4 		mmmm , that's someone who's helping to clean up an oil spill showing what the oil looks like . 
_t4 		that's a different kind of oil +... 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 
_t4 		oh . 

_t4 		mam [: madam] , you can hold it with your hands , can't you ? 

_t4 		oh , what kind of texture was that oil ? 
_t4 		o:h . 
_t4 		huh . 
_t4 		must be hard to get clean at the end of the day for you . 

_t4 		that won't hurt them ? 
_t4 		uh+huh .
_t4 
_t4 		and it'll [: it will] take the oil off ?
_t4 
_t4 		oh , that's good . 
_t4 		I'm sure that chicken will need to rest in the veterinary hospital for a while . 
_t4 		before it's returned . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		leave that alone , okay ?
_t4 
_t4 		okay , and what am I doing ? 

_t4 
_t4 		how (a)bout if I clip it to the bear ? 
_t4 		xxx you have_to +//. 
_t4 		that means you have_to keep them still though . 
_t4 		okay , keep him +... 
_t4 		well , while you're in the , while you're in the wagon just keep him right where he is okay . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		but what's important is +//. 
_t4 		in fact I'm gonna see if we +/. 
_t4 		it's okay like this .
_t4 
_t4 		it's okay like this . 
_t4 		xxx but the important thing is not to touch that too much .
_t4 
_t4 		or not to touch it at all actually . 
_t4 		(be)cause that would mean we'd just hear fuzz when we play it back 
_t4 		this is the microphone , if you touch it it's gonna (.) give a fuzz sound which won't be good .
_t4 
_t4 		no . 
_t4 		so who's the customer am I gonna be a customer ? 
_t4 		oh yeah . 
_t4 		yeah +//. 
_t4 		Naima's voice +/.
_t4 
_t4 		I noticed that . 
_t4 		Naima's voice is not quite what it usually is . 
_t4 		what does this go to ? 
_t4 		oh right , okay . 
_t4 		okay , I'm the store+owner . 
_t4 		where is it +//? 
_t4 		it's over there . 
_t4 		there's a book mess on the floor +//. 
_t4 		I don't think you can use the wagon when there's a book mess , can you ? 
_t4 		mmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		really ? 
_t4 		which way ? 
_t4 		which way ? 
_t4 		I didn't see which way you were pointing . 
_t4 		this way ? 
_t4 		that way ? 
_t4 		that+a+way that+a+way .
_t4 
_t4 		this way that+a+way . 
_t4 		oh , clunk  . 
_t4 		I don't think we're gonna have a blizzard like that in a long time , Naima . 
_t4 		that was probably one of the worst blizzards that Cape Cod has had in the last fifty years . 
_t4 		it's a lotta [: lot of] years , yep [: yes] . 
_t4 		twelve is a lotta [: lot of] years too . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		yep [: yes] . 
_t4 		there was a very bad blizzard , almost this bad , seventeen years ago . 
_t4 		that's a long time ago too , isn't it ? 
_t4 		I guess Daddy will wear his mic(rophone) . 
_t4 		although it's actually Naima's . 
_t4 		a voice we really wanna have on our recording . 
_t4 		I wish Naima would wear the microphone on her shirt so we would have a very good recording . 
_t4 		if she stays where she is right now it'll be fine . 
_t4 		if you wore the microphone on your shirt we would have a very good recording . 
_t4 		oh , I know , that's what Mommy says .
_t4 
_t4 		but I think if you really wanted a really good recording , you would wear it on your shirt . 
_t4 		if you wanted it . 
_t4 		that way we +/.
_t4 		I'm gotta open up my store . 
_t4 		hope I get a lotta [: lot of] money and a lotta [: lot of] buyers today . 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		okay , and what are we doing now . 
_t4 		are we going to the grocery store ?
_t4 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		I'm I'm videotaping people at my store . 
_t4 		oh , some stores do that , did you realize that ? 
_t4 		some stores do that to protect themselves from robbers . 
_t4 		well sometimes robbers go into stores when they wanna steal things and not pay money .
_t4 
_t4 		well because if it's recorded on the video then we have a picture of who the robber was and then the police can go find them later . 
_t4 		so , that tells them they really shouldn't do that (be)cause they'll get caught very easily . 
_t4 		well because if they know that there's pictures being taken of them , then (.) then they'll know that police can find them . 
_t4 		yeah , that's the idea . 
_t4 		so: , shall we go to the store ? 
_t4 		(o)kay . 
_t4 		so you're not gonna be Miss Chaos in this one are you . 
_t4 		oh you're Miss Chaos the sister , okay . 
