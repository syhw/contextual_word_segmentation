_t4 		wow +...
_t4 
_t4 		oh in the sky .
_t4 
_t4 		they're gonna try and catch it but I don't think so I think that you can't catch a rainbow .
_t4 
_t4 		well that's [: that is] a good thing (be)cause if they caught the rainbow no one would be able to see the rainbow and wouldn't we all be sad ? 
_t4 		we don't want the goblins to steal the rainbow right ? 
_t4 		no .
_t4 
_t4 		we'll spend the night here in the cave the yellow goblin commanded . 
_t4 		when the moon rose and saw them warming themselves around the fire they had lit it shouted out an alarm . 
_t4 		the rainbow goblins are in the valley . 
_t4 		the trees and the bushes took up the cry and the flowers and the grasses and the animals and the waters passed it on and by midnight the evil tidings had spread throughout the valley . 
_t4 		look at the big beautiful moon . 
_t4 		the goblins could hardly contain their excitement . 
_t4 		soon all the colors of the rainbow will be ours Yellow gloated . 
_t4 		we'll snatch it as it rises when the colors are still fresh and creamy . 
_t4 		the blue goblin cackled look at the roots dangling from the walls they're straining to hear our plans . 
_t4 		a lot of good it will do them or their friend the rainbow . 
_t4 		finally exhausted by their scheming the goblins fell asleep . 
_t4 		outside the moon shone on the mirror like surface of the water and its magical light was reflected in the cave . 
_t4 		then all seven goblins had a wonderful dream .

_t4 		and the most succulent colors dripped down your throat . 

_t4 		rides a bike .
_t4 
_t4 		Franklin could swim underwater and hit a home run . 
_t4 		he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swing . 
_t4 		but Franklin had a problem he couldn't ride his bike without his training wheels . 
_t4 		Beaver was the brave one she took her extra wheels off first . 
_t4 		she practiced and practiced then she went to the park to show off . 
_t4 		look at me she shouted I can ride my bike all by myself . 
_t4 		Franklin watched Beaver ride around in circles . 
_t4 		it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handle bar with the other . 
_t4 		soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels . 
_t4 		we're going on a picnic said Bear come on . 
_t4 		Franklin was worried his friends would make fun of his training wheels so he fibbed and said I'm not hungry and went home to eat lunch alone . 
_t4 		&aw that's [: that is] kinda [: kind of] sad isn't it ? 
_t4 		yeah .

_t4 		just like when you go skating you wear your helmet right ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike . 
_t4 		he wanted to ride all by himself . 
_t4 		he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push . 
_t4 		Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered . 

_t4 
_t4 		I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again . 
_t4 		for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out . 
_t4 		he watched as his friends rode off without him . 
_t4 		they were becoming great explorers on their bikes . 
_t4 		what are they on here ? 

_t4 		xxx Franklin sat on his bike . 
_t4 		it's tippy he cried . 
_t4 		his mother held on to the seat try it I won't let you go until you tell me to . 
_t4 		Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bicycle from behind . 
_t4 		he felt very unsteady and very unsure . 
_t4 		I'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling . 
_t4 		riding a bicycle is difficult said his mother but you can't give up just because it's frustrating . 
_t4 		it's too hard for me said Franklin it was easy for my friends . 
_t4 		do you think everything comes easily for them she asked . 
_t4 		Franklin had to think about that . 
_t4 		Franklin went to the park he saw Beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars . 
_t4 		each time she got_to the third rung she fell into the sand below . 
_t4 		no Beaver said Bear do it like this it's easy . 
_t4 		easy for you said Beaver she tried one more time and fell again . 
_t4 		maybe tomorrow Beaver grumbled . 

_t4 		xxx ! 
_t4 		then you fell . 
_t4 		but I caught you right you didn't really fall . 
_t4 		Franklin remembered when Beav(er) when Badger learned to swim she was afraid to put her head underwater . 
_t4 		it's easy said Franklin just do it . 
_t4 		Badger had spluttered and cried it took her a long time to feel good in the water . 
_t4 		but now she could swim from one end of the pond to the other .
_t4 
_t4 		I think she's swimming underwater . 
_t4 		are you gonna swim underwater one day ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		with goggles like Phoebe wow that's going to be neat .
_t4 
_t4 		Franklin thought about the first time Fox played baseball . 
_t4 		he couldn't hit the ball at all . 
_t4 		but he tried and tried until one day Fox got a home run . 
_t4 		xxx he's playing baseball . 

_t4 		that's it cried Franklin and he hurried home . 
_t4 		Franklin put on +... 
_t4 		padding .
_t4 
_t4 		he lined the walk with old pillows . 
_t4 		I'm ready to try again he told his mother and now I won't worry if I fall . 
_t4 		Franklin sat on his bike and his mother held on to the seat . 
_t4 		Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered and he fell many times but he never gave up . 
_t4 		then it happened Franklin told his mother to let go . 
_t4 		he didn't veer into the bushes and he didn't crash . 
_t4 		way to go cheered his mother . 
_t4 		Franklin was thrilled . 
_t4 		finally he was riding his bike all by himself . 
_t4 		I can do it he shouted . 
_t4 		Franklin rode to the park to show his friends . 
_t4 		look at me he called . 

_t4 		every morning as the sun peaks over the horizon , a giant rock formation catches the first rays of light . 
_t4 		this is Pride rock . 
_t4 		home to my good friend , king +... 
_t4 		who is that ? 
_t4 		on this particular morning , animals from all over the Pride lands had come to Pride rock to celebrate the birth of their newborn cub , Simba . 
_t4 		as part of the celebration , I had a special duty . 
_t4 		then I lifted the future king up high for all to see . 
_t4 		the elephants trumpeted with their trunks , the monkeys jumped up and down , and the zebras stamped their hoofs with happiness . 
_t4 		what animals do you see ? 
_t4 		xxx you're right , where are the monkeys ? 
_t4 		here they are , and what else do you see ? 
_t4 		uh+huh .
_t4 
_t4 		and what else ? 
_t4 		the elephants , and do you remember what this is ? 
_t4 		what kind of animal is that ? 
_t4 		think so . 
_t4 		not far from the ceremony , in a cave at the back side of Pride rock , a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled , life's [: life is] not fair , I shall never be king . 
_t4 		who's that ? 
_t4 		moments later , Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave . 
_t4 		Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba , he said . 
_t4 		you should have been first in line . 
_t4 		I was first in line until that little hair+ball was born , he said , and Scar stalked out of the cave . 
_t4 		that's Zazu .
_t4 
_t4 		he's a bird , right ? 
_t4 		uh+huh . 
_t4 		before long , Simba grew into a healthy , playful young cub . 
_t4 		early one morning , he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock . 
_t4 		as they looked out at the rising sun , Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands . 
_t4 		look Simba , he said , everything the light touches is our kingdom . 
_t4 		Simba scanned the horizon and noticed a dark spot in the distance . 
_t4 		what about that shadowy place ? 
_t4 		that's beyond our borders , you must never go there Simba . 
_t4 		but I thought a king can do whatever he wants . 
_t4 		there's more to being king than getting your way all the time . 
_t4 		everything you see exists together in a delicate balance . 
_t4 		as king , you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures . 
_t4 		from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope . 
_t4 		we're all connected in the great Circle of life . 
_t4 		later , as Simba headed back down the path , he ran into Scar . 
_t4 		hey uncle Scar , guess what , I'm gonna be king of Pride rock . 
_t4 		my dad showed me the whole kingdom , and I'm gonna rule it all . 
_t4 		Scar looked slyly at the young cub . 
_t4 		he didn't show you what's beyond that rise of the northern border . 
_t4 		well no , he said I couldn't go there . 
_t4 		oh he's right , it's far too dangerous . 
_t4 		only the bravest lions go there . 
_t4 		hello ? 
_t4 		&er . 
_t4 		come on , I just heard about this great place . 
_t4 		the mothers gave permission for the youngsters to go , as long as Zazu went with them . 
_t4 		Simba and Nala raced across the Pride lands in an effort to lose the watchful bird . 
_t4 		they led him through many herds of animals until they finally lost him . 
_t4 		once the cubs were free of Zazu , Simba pounced on Nala . 
_t4 		then Nala flipped Simba onto his back . 
_t4 		they tumbled down a hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones . 
_t4 		Simba looked around and gasped . 
_t4 		this is it , we made it ! 
_t4 		but before the cubs could explore any farther , Zazu tracked them down . 
_t4 		we're way beyond the boundary of the Pride lands , and right now , we are all in very real danger . 
_t4 		xxx , who's that . 
_t4 		who are those ? 
_t4 		what kind of animals are they ?
_t4 
_t4 		are they , cows ?
_t4

_t4 
_t4 		moose ?
_t4 
_t4 		kitty+cats ?
_t4 
_t4 		what are they ?
_t4 
_t4 		they're hy(enas) +...
_t4 
_t4 		hy(enas) +...
_t4 
_t4 		aren't they hyenas ?
_t4 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		do hyenas laugh a lot ? 
_t4 		yes .
_t4 
_t4 		what are their names ? 
_t4 		do you remember one name ? 
_t4 		Mary ?
_t4 
_t4 		Joe ? 
_t4 		Bobo ?
_t4 
_t4 		what did Maria say that day to Tamar at the play+ground ?
_t4 
_t4 		Toma Toma !
_t4 
_t4 		xxx you're very giggly today .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		okay , do you remember any of their names ? 
_t4 		why are you so , what's so silly ?
_t4 
_t4 		and the always laughing Ed . 
_t4 		Banzai gra:bbed Zazu by the neck and plopped him down . 
_t4 		xxx hyenas circled their prey , licking their chops . 
_t4 		what's the hurry , we'd love you to stick around for dinner . 
_t4 		while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom , Simba , Nala , and Zazu quickly slipped away . 
_t4 		but the hyenas weren't distracted for long . 
_t4 		they gave chase , and Simba and Nala had to run as fast as they could . 
_t4 		finally they tried hiding behind some elephant bones . 
_t4 		just when it looked as if it were all over for the young cubs , Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with one swipe of his big paw . 
_t4 		if you ever come near my son again , he said . 
_t4 		the hyenas slinked away and Mufasa glared at Simba . 
_t4 		you deliberately disobeyed me , I'm very disappointed . 
_t4 		Mufasa sent Nala and Zazu home so he could talk privately to his son . 
_t4 		Simba peered up at his father . 
_t4 		I was just trying to be brave , like you . 
_t4 		well their home is back in the Pride lands , but right now they're just looking , at the ,  , at the stars , right ? 
_t4 		sparkly ? 
_t4 		do you still have all three rings ? 
_t4 		mhm . 
_t4 		wow , nice . 
_t4 		Dad , we're pals , right , and we'll always be together , right , said Simba . 
_t4 		Mufasa looked up at the stars . 
_t4 		Simba , let me tell you something my father told me . 
_t4 		look at the stars . 
_t4 		great kings of the past look down on us from these stars . 
_t4 		so whenever you feel alone , just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you , and so will I . 
_t4 		meanwhile , the hyenas received another visitor . 
_t4 		an angry Scar showed up at their lair . 
_t4 		I practically gift+wrapped those cubs and you couldn't even dispose of them , he said . 
_t4 		Scar warned the hyenas to be prepared . 
_t4 		be prepared for what , Banzai laughed . 
_t4 		for the death of the king , said Scar . 
_t4 		the following day , Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge . 
_t4 		when they arrived , Scar turned to his young nephew . 
_t4 		now you wait here , your father has a marvelous surprise for you . 
_t4 		well he has some hair on his head . 
_t4 		mhm .
_t4 
_t4 		ah+hah ! 
_t4 		Scar signaled the hyenas , who chased a herd of wildebeest directly towards Simba . 
_t4 		they've just a tiny little tiny bit of hair . 
_t4 		and ears , too , they have ears too , right ?
_t4 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		hmmm+hmmm+hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx goodness . 
_t4 		from a distance , Mufasa noticed the rising dust . 
_t4 		Scar appeared quickly at his side . 
_t4 		stampede in the gorge , Simba's [: Simba is] down there ! 
_t4 		without waiting a second , Mufasa took off to save his young son .
_t4 
_t4 		I guess he'd have_to jump . 
_t4 		he found Simba , grabbed him the nape of his neck , and pulled him onto a nearby ledge . 
_t4 		but suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede . 
_t4 		desperately he tried to climb up another ledge from which Scar stood looking down on him . 
_t4 		help me Brother , he said . 
_t4 		Scar reached for Mufasa and pulled him close enough to whisper in his ear , long live the king , and let go of Mufasa . 
_t4 		Simba peered over the ridge just as his father disappeared beneath the thundering stampede . 
_t4 		later , Scar found Simba hovering over his father , sobbing . 
_t4 		it was an accident , I didn't mean for it to happen . 
_t4 		what am I going to do ? 
_t4 		run away Simba , said Scar , run away and never return . 
_t4 		Scar returned to Pride rock to take over the throne . 
_t4 		meanwhile , Simba plodded across the Savanna without any food or water . 
_t4 		it wasn't long before he fainted under the hot hot sun . 
_t4 		he's so cute and all alone , can we keep him ? 
_t4 		Pumbaa are you nuts , lions eat guys like us . 
_t4 		but Pumbaa scooped Simba him up anyway and carried him to safety . 
_t4 		when Simba awoke , the first thing that sprang to his mind was his father . 
_t4 		you've got_to put your past behind you , he said , and that's exactly what Simba did . 
_t4 		he stayed in the jungle with Pumbaa and Timon a long long time and grew into a very big lion . 
_t4 		but eventually he got homesick . 
_t4 		and one night he looked at the stars and recalled the words his father had told him a long time ago . 
_t4 		who is that ? 
_t4 		who's that ? 
_t4 		it's Nala . 
_t4 		Nala what are you doing here ? 
_t4 		why didn't you come back to Pride rock , you're the king , she said . 
_t4 		I'm not the king , Scar is . 
_t4 		Simba , he let the hyenas take over the Pride lands , there's no food or water , and if you don't come back soon , everyone will be in trouble , you're our only hope ! 
_t4 		I can't go back . 
_t4 		Simba yelled at the heavens , you said you'd always be there for me but you're not . 
_t4 		because of me . 
_t4 		Simba didn't believe he could challenge Scar to the throne , so he stayed in the jungle with Nala and his new friends . 
_t4 		but I knew the time had come for Simba to take his place in the circle of life , and I headed for the jungle . 
_t4 		when Simba saw me , he was surprised . 
_t4 		who are you ? 
_t4 		question is , I asked , who are you ? 
_t4 		I thought I knew , but now I'm not so sure . 
_t4 		well I know who you are , you're Mufasa's boy . 
_t4 		I led Simba to a reflecting pool . 
_t4 		when he looked in the water he saw a lion . 
_t4 		that's not my father , it's just my reflection . 
_t4 		look harder , he lives in you , I said . 
_t4 		the ghost of Mufasa magically appeared . 
_t4 		look inside yourself Simba , you are more than what you have become . 

_t4 		he looks a little scary but he's still very nice . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		when Simba arrived back at Pride rock , he found the land bare and dry . 
_t4 		the hyenas were in control and Scar was shouting at Simba's mother . 
_t4 		suddenly , a flash of lightning revealed the edge of Pride rock , and there stood Simba . 
_t4 		Scar jumped back . 
_t4 		Simba , I'm a little surprised to see you , alive . 
_t4 		give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart , said Simba . 
_t4 		Scar started to slink off but he turned and lunged one last time at Simba . 
_t4 		Simba moved quickly and flipped Scar over the edge where a pack of hyenas were waiting hungrily . 
_t4 		limping badly , Simba climbed to the top of Pride rock . 
_t4 		he let out a magnificent roar as he looked over his kingdom . 
_t4 		before long , Pride rock flourished again . 
_t4 		Nala remained by Simba's side and soon they had their own newborn cub . 
_t4 		with their friends around , including Zazu , Pumbaa and Timon , a new celebration of life took place . 
_t4 		after making a mark on the forehead of the young cub , I held him up for all the kingdom to see . 
