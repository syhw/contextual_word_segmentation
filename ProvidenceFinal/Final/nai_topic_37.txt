_t4 		did we say what was the date today ? 
_t4 		do you remember ? 
_t4 		was it the seventeenth or the eighteenth . 
_t4 		(be)cause you looked at it on the calendar and so did I . 
_t4 		the different color ? 
_t4 		yeah bean seeds are not all the same color .
_t4 		okay , signet marigold .

_t4 		that they never came up ?
_t4 		I know . 
_t4 		sow seeds outdoors in early (.) spring . 
_t4 		maybe we should +//.

_t4 		we have some containers but we don't +//. 
_t4 		we don't quite have enough . 
_t4 		this is parsley .

_t4 		uh .
_t4 		I know . 
_t4 		best grown as a   crop .
_t4 		plant in mid+june .
_t4 		I don't think so . 
_t4 		I don't know why the carrots didn't come up .
_t4 		I've always had trouble growing carrots . 
_t4 		I don't know if it's because of the soil . 
_t4 		it's not the right kind of soil or what . 
_t4 		these need to be planted in June . 
_t4 		or July . 
_t4 		what does it look like . 
_t4 		(doe)s it look the same ? 
_t4 		it doesn't look any different at all ?

_t4 		and this is the (.) chard . 
_t4 		blooms during mid+spring . 
_t4 		to mid+summer . 
_t4 		the cal(endula) +//. 
_t4 		well the +... 
_t4 		zinnias never came up . 
_t4 		there are two kinds of chard this year .
_t4 		xxx  . 
_t4 		after all danger of frosts has past .

_t4 		that's all I'm gonna give you right now because we're getting ready +... 
_t4 		let's see , after last frost .
_t4 		to go investigate the problem with the grow core . 
_t4 		or maybe to go to the garden store .
_t4 		plant outdoors today . 
_t4 		(be)cause we need some flats to sow seeds in . 
_t4 		okay .

_t4 		xxx .

_t4 		not different . 
_t4 		I'm gonna take this +...

_t4 		possibly +... 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 		I don't know let's sit here a while longer . 
_t4 		I do not know why this is happening . 
_t4 		but I think maybe we shouldn't have put the stuff on top of it to weight it down . 
_t4 		let's leave it like this . 
_t4 		I'm gonna leave it here a while longer . 
_t4 		now I think +...

_t4 		I know you did .
_t4 		I don't want you to touch the grow core . 
_t4 		I want it to stay there and I want it to work . 
_t4 		so we have_to leave it alone so that it will work . 
_t4 		hee   .
