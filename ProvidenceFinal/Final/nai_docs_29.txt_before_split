_d5306 		why do they what ? 
_d5306 		well so they don't run into the land and break the ship , that's why . 
_d5306 		why , because ships are for the ocean they're just for floating in the water , they don't come on land . 
_d5306 		and sometimes if they hit the land they can break . 
_d5306 		and water can get on the ship and it could sink , so they want to stay away from the land . 
_d5306 		and when it's foggy they can't see the land . 
_d5306 		and if they can't see the land they don't know where it is , that's why fog+horns help them , fog+horns help them know where the land is . 
_d5306 		come sit here little ship . 
_d5306 		so when it's really foggy all they have_to do is listen . 
_d5306 		and when they listen they can hear the fog+horn and that tells them  there's land there we better stay away . 

_d5309 		but instead he fixed it and now it says Dada .
_d5309 
_d5309 		xxx , funny Mister Fixit . 

_d5310 		I don't want you to do that , are you gonna eat some egg white and egg yolk ? 

_d5310 		no it's a big boat , somebody's in it while he's fixing it . 
_d5310 		oh . 
_d5310 		so that it won't sink . 
_d5310 		if a boat has a leak it might sink . 

_d5310 
_d5310 		
_d5310 		I guess Philip's wagon was broken . 
_d5310 		maybe the wheel was broken .
_d5310 
_d5310 		Mister Fixit likes to fix everything he touches practically .

_d5311 		when he was fixing it . 
_d5311 		xxx .
_d5311 
_d5311 		he was supposed to fix it so it said Mama .
_d5311 
_d5311 		but instead he fixed it so it said Dada . 
_d5311 		I think he probably was (.) reading the wrong directions when he fixed it .
_d5311 
_d5311 		like sometimes you need directions to fix things , you need to read from a paper with directions . 
_d5311 		hmmm . 
_d5311 		his refrigerator wasn't making any ice . 
_d5311 		and he fixed it . 
_d5311 		he had to read the directions for how to fix it . 

_d5311 
_d5311 		remember , what was I reading  ,  , remember when I was trying to try out the backpack to carry you in ? 
_d5311 		I had to read the directions . 
_d5311 		directions explain how to use something or how to fix something . 
_d5311 		mmmm+hmmm .
_d5311 
_d5311 		when it first came when we first took it out of the box .

_d5313 		xxx .
_d5313 
_d5313 		it was spectacular . 
_d5313 		a spectacular turnaround . 
_d5313 		I wonder if fog is a mosquito deterrent . 
_d5313 		hmmm . 
_d5313 		wishful thinking . 
_d5313 		I don't think so .
_d5313 
_d5313 		xxx . 
_d5313 		mosquitos repelled by fog ! 
_d5313 		could be the cool temperatures associated with it .

_d5313 		xxx .
_d5313 
_d5313 		there are probably many different kinds of fog . 
_d5313 		but we don't know them . 
_d5313 		we would probably have fifty words for fog if we lived in Maine .
_d5313 
_d5313 		and warm fog !
_d5313 
_d5313 		and warm fog !
_d5313

_d5314 		you can cut one piece and then I want you to eat it . 
_d5314 		mmmm . 
_d5314 		is it really shorter to go on the ferries ? 
_d5314 		oh it , in terms of amount of time , no it's probably shorter to go the other way cause [: because] I think if you drive to Eastport it's probably about an hour . 
_d5314 		from here . 
_d5314 		yeah .
_d5314 
_d5314 		it's just it's more interesting and more broken up but you know , if you go by ferry , I mean if it's say fifteen minutes for the ferry , each ferry that's half an hour of a wait plus each one is about twenty+five minutes , that's an hour and a half plus the drive time , so +... 
_d5314 		it's probably longer to go that way . 
_d5314 		not that it'll be very spectacular , that is really one of , the Eastport to Deer Island ferry is just one of those local ferries .
_d5314 
_d5314 		well the thing is if we drove there , and then took the ferry back , by then it might not +...
_d5314

_d5315 		I think that's what you're asking .
_d5315 
_d5315 		hmmm .
_d5315 
_d5315 		cause [: because] I said maybe that's +... 
_d5315 		well Mommy thought maybe mosquitos don't like fog , so that the fog will keep them away .
_d5315 
_d5315 		Mommy was more hoping that than thinking that .
_d5315 
_d5315 		I think Mommy was engaging in something called wishful thinking .
_d5315 
_d5315 		yes . 
_d5315 		that's called wishful thinking , that's when you wish something's true .
_d5315

_d5328 
_d5328 		because things are more stable if they're not on just one lego . 

_d5328 		if you put the wider legos on the bottom it'll be more stable . 
_d5328 		see this is wider (.) and this is skinny and narrow . 
_d5328 		if you put the narrow towers on top of the wider towers it'll be more stable . 
_d5328 		yeah , even that is better . 
_d5328 		that , if I were you I'd put that on the bottom . 
_d5328 		'cause [: because] that's really stable , that's like a platform . 
_d5328 		it's a pretty big tower though . 
_d5328 		and you're doing a good job by holding onto it with one hand , that also helps . 
_d5328 		to keep it more stable . 

_d5330 
_d5330 		and the other thing is it's hard to make things stable on (.) carpet like this .
_d5330 
_d5330 		'cause [: because] it's sort of uneven . 
_d5330 		things would be more stable on that floor which is much more flat . 

_d5340 		xxx .
_d5340 
_d5340 		munching berries and swallowing them  . 
_d5340 		getting fat for the winter . 
_d5340 		xxx  .
_d5340 
_d5340 		'cause [: because] bears sleep the whole winter . 
_d5340 		did you know that ?
_d5340 
_d5340 		they sleep the who:le winter . 
_d5340 		and so they need to eat a lo:t of food before they go to sleep , just like you need to eat a lo:t of (.) food at supper+time so (.) you'll have lots_of food in your tummy when you go to sleep so you could sleep all night . 
_d5340 		xxx .

_d5340 		they sleep . 
_d5341 		xxx . 
_d5341 		that's a good question . 

_d5341 
_d5341 		she was lying in bed .
_d5341 
_d5341 		when she heard that sound outside her window . 
_d5341 		so she realized that she'd better do something or else she's not gonna sleep all night 'cause [: because] she'll be listening to the bear going  . 
_d5341 		that bear had a bad tooth+ache . 
_d5341 		I guess he didn't brush his teeth regularly . 
_d5341 		that's why . 
_d5341 		so she invited him in 'cause [: because] she wanted to help him so that he wouldn't have a tooth+ache so he wouldn't be making so much noise all night so she: could go to sleep . 
_d5341 		I think that's really why she helped him . 
_d5341 		and maybe she helped him because she didn't like hearing him suffer and be so miserable . 
_d5341 		maybe she wanted to make him feel better just so he would feel better . 
_d5341 		well you know , like Daddy said , you could pinch the stem off like tha:t and then you could eat the berry ! 

_d5402 		he had just come to the bridge . 
_d5402 		and he was not looking where he was going . 
_d5402 		well he was supposed to be going over a bridge I think , but he was not looking where he was going . 

_d5402 		he tripped over something . 
_d5402 		I don't think we know . 
_d5402 		bother , said Pooh , as it floated under the bridge . 
_d5402 		he looked at the river as it slipped slowly away beneath him . 

_d5402 		that's funny , said Pooh . 
_d5402 		I dropped it on the other side and it came out on this side . 

_d5402 		it did . 
_d5402 		it kept on doing it . 
_d5402 		then he dropped two: in at once and leaned over the bridge to see which of them would come out first . 

_d5402 		but as they were both the same size , Pooh didn't know if it was the one he wanted to win , or the other one . 

_d5402 		the big one came out first . 
_d5402 		which is what he had said it would do . 
_d5402 		and the little one came out last , which was what he had said it would do . 
