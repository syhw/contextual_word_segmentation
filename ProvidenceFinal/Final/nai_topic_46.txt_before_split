_t4 		it's okay like this .
_t4 
_t4 		it's okay like this . 
_t4 		xxx but the important thing is not to touch that too much .
_t4 
_t4 		or not to touch it at all actually . 
_t4 		(be)cause that would mean we'd just hear fuzz when we play it back 
_t4 		this is the microphone , if you touch it it's gonna (.) give a fuzz sound which won't be good .
_t4 
_t4 		no . 
_t4 		so who's the customer am I gonna be a customer ? 

_t4 		which way ? 
_t4 		I didn't see which way you were pointing . 
_t4 		this way ? 
_t4 		that way ? 
_t4 		that+a+way that+a+way .
_t4 
_t4 		this way that+a+way . 
_t4 		oh , clunk  . 
_t4 		I don't think we're gonna have a blizzard like that in a long time , Naima . 
_t4 		that was probably one of the worst blizzards that Cape Cod has had in the last fifty years . 
_t4 		it's a lotta [: lot of] years , yep [: yes] . 
_t4 		twelve is a lotta [: lot of] years too . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		yep [: yes] . 
_t4 		there was a very bad blizzard , almost this bad , seventeen years ago . 
_t4 		that's a long time ago too , isn't it ? 
_t4 		I guess Daddy will wear his mic(rophone) . 
_t4 		although it's actually Naima's . 
_t4 		a voice we really wanna have on our recording . 
_t4 		I wish Naima would wear the microphone on her shirt so we would have a very good recording . 
_t4 		if she stays where she is right now it'll be fine . 
_t4 		if you wore the microphone on your shirt we would have a very good recording . 
_t4 		oh , I know , that's what Mommy says .
_t4 
_t4 		but I think if you really wanted a really good recording , you would wear it on your shirt . 

_t4 		that way we +/.
_t4 		I'm gotta open up my store . 

_t4 		okay , and what are we doing now . 
_t4 		are we going to the grocery store ?
_t4 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		I'm I'm videotaping people at my store . 
_t4 		oh , some stores do that , did you realize that ? 
_t4 		some stores do that to protect themselves from robbers . 
_t4 		well sometimes robbers go into stores when they wanna steal things and not pay money .
_t4 
_t4 		well because if it's recorded on the video then we have a picture of who the robber was and then the police can go find them later . 
_t4 		so , that tells them they really shouldn't do that (be)cause they'll get caught very easily . 
_t4 		well because if they know that there's pictures being taken of them , then (.) then they'll know that police can find them . 
_t4 		yeah , that's the idea . 
_t4 		so: , shall we go to the store ? 
