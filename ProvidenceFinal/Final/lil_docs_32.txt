_d3498 		one day the mirror said , a lovely maid I see , who is more fair than thee . 
_d3498 		the queen knew , it must be Snow white . 
_d3498 		Snow white was so beautiful and kind , that even a handsome prince who was passing by soon noticed her . 
_d3498 		little did he know that when he came into the courtyard to sing to Snow white , the evil queen was watching nearby . 

_d3498 
_d3498 		ooh , now she's wearing a red bow , you're right .
_d3498 
_d3498 		Snow white realized she must leave home or risk being hurt by the queen . 
_d3498 		Snow white was so frightened that she ran deep into the forest . 
_d3498 		do you know where I can stay , she asked a group of friendly animals . 

_d3500 		the animals led Snow white to a tiny cottage in the woods . 
_d3500 		she knocked on the door but no one answered . 
_d3500 		so she slowly stepped inside . 
_d3500 		Snow white found seven tiny bowls , seven tiny chairs , and seven tiny beds . 

_d3500 		let's clean the house and surprise them , she said to the animals . 

_d3500 		soon seven tiny men arrived , the seven dwarves . 
_d3500 		Snow white promised to wash and sew and sweep for the little men . 
_d3500 		in return , they kept her safe and happy . 
_d3500 		the seven dwarfs loved having Snow white stay in their cottage . 
_d3500 		back at the castle , the magic mirror told the queen where Snow white was hiding . 
_d3500 		the queen was so angry that she drank a potion and turned herself into an old hag . 
_d3500 		and then she created a magic apple . 
_d3500 		with one bite of this poisoned apple , Snow white's eyes will close forever . 
_d3500 		as soon as the dwarves went to work , the queen , disguised as a peddler woman , approached Snow white . 
_d3500 		the forest animals recognized the queen and ran off to warn the dwarves . 
_d3500 		but by the time the dwarves arrived , it was too late . 
_d3500 		Snow white had already taken a bite of the poisoned apple , and +/.
_d3500 
_d3500 		she took a bite of that  apple , and she fell asleep .
_d3500 
_d3500 		oh my . 
_d3500 		the evil queen fled from the cottage but the seven dwarves raced after her and chased her to a rocky cliff . 
_d3500 		well , the the seven dwarves are angry at the witch , because she's not very nice to Snow white .
_d3500 
_d3500 		well , the seven dwarves are nice , they're just angry . 
_d3500 		a rock broke beneath her feet and the queen fell from the mountaintop into the darkness below . 
