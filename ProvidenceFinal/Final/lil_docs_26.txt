_d3897 		as soon as he washed and dried the dishes . 
_d3897 		and made his bed nice and neat . 
_d3897 		he ran down the street to the barber shop . 
_d3897 		Lou Kangaroo had a chair waiting for him . 
_d3897 		and then gave him a shampoo . 
_d3897 		Dandelion thought he should have a manicure to . 

_d3897 		all you need now is a cap and a cane . 

_d3897 		I've just time to get something for my hostess . 
_d3897 		a bouquet of dandelions would be perfect . 
_d3897 		he knew this tall door very well . 
_d3897 		having been here many times before . 
_d3897 		he rang the bell . 
_d3897 		when Jennifer Giraffe opened the door she looked very surprised . 
_d3897 		yes she said . 
_d3897 		what can I do for you ? 
_d3897 		but I'm here for your party he said . 
_d3897 		why I'm sorry sir you are not anyone I know she said . 
_d3897 		you must have the wrong address . 
_d3897 		and with that she closed the door right in poor Dandelion's face . 
_d3897 		I'm Dandelion he roared you've made a mining mistake . 
_d3897 		but the door stayed tight shut . 
_d3897 		Dandelion walked back and forth down the block . 
_d3897 		and as he paced +...
_d3897 
_d3897 		he is sad .
_d3897 
_d3897 		the sky grew dark . 
_d3897 		and a sudden gust of wind sprang up and blew away his beautiful bouquet . 
_d3897 		they blew away in the wind . 
_d3897 		oh no . 
_d3897 		to make matters worse it began to rain in ? 
_d3897 		Torrance . 
_d3897 		Dandelion dropped his cane . 
_d3897 		and stood under a weeping willow tree . 
_d3897 		but the rain pored down through the branches . 
_d3897 		Dandelion was soon soak and wet and his curls came unfurled . 
_d3897 		he took off his jacket . 
_d3897 		and hung it on a willow branch . 
_d3897 		luckily he had kept on his sweater . 
_d3897 		at last the rain stopped . 
_d3897 		and the warm sunshine came down . 

_d3897 
_d3897 		more dandelions . 
_d3897 		they had been protected .
_d3897 
_d3897 		they didn't blow away . 

_d3897 		he picked the dandelions and said I think I will try again . 
_d3897 		and rang the bell . 
_d3897 		well if it isn't our friend Dandelion . 
_d3897 		we've been waiting for over an hour for you . 
_d3897 		I do hope you weren't caught in that awful cloud burst . 
_d3897 		everyone at the party greeted him hardly . 
_d3897 		and Jennifer Giraffe told Dandelion about the silly looking lion that had come to the door . 
_d3897 		Dandelion almost spilt his cup of tea . 
_d3897 		that was me I was the silly looking one .
