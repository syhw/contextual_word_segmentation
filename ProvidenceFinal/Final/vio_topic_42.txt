_t4 		yeah !
_t4 
_t4 		remember when your mother told you to stop playing with your food ? 
_t4 		that's the opposite of what goes on at the Minnesota zoo where zoo+keeper Ross Taylor encourages tigers to play with their food . 
_t4 		Taylor often tosses tiger popsicles three pound meaty horse bones frozen inside heavy chunks of ice into the moat surrounding the tiger enclosure where two year old Maya and her siblings live . 
_t4 		as soon as they hear a splash the tigers jump in . 
_t4 		each cat grabs a popsicle while the others drag their treats to shore . 
_t4 		Maya carries hers into deeper water . 
_t4 		she has figured out that ice melts faster in the moat's water than it does in the air . 
_t4 		her siblings have_to wait a couple of hours to enjoy their bone treats but Maya is gnawing on hers after only twenty minutes . 
_t4 		this is one tiger that prefers fast food . 
_t4 		this feeding technique encourages the big cats to swim something tigers enjoy in the wild . 
_t4 		it also provides them with exercise and keeps helps keep them from becoming bored . 
_t4 		xxx . 

_t4 		that could be delicate even old stuff can be delicate . 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		modern zoos recognize that to stay healthy captive animals need exercise play interaction with other animals and interesting ways to eat . 
_t4 		toy tool ? 
_t4 		to keep him busy and distract him from expensive stuff like microphones researcher Patricia Cole gave Loki a miniature frisbee to play with . 
_t4 		curious about how water was getting into Loki's dry food Cole set up video cameras to find out . 
_t4 		she discovered that Loki had turned his toy frisbee into a tool . 
_t4 		crows like their food moistened so the brainy bird used the frisbee to scoop water out of his bath pan and carry it to his food bowl where he poured it onto his chow . 
_t4 		later Loki used a cup that Cole gave him . 
_t4 		Loki developed this behavior all on his own says Cole but if I hadn't given him the frisbee it wouldn't have never happened . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		he figured that out he's smart huh ?
_t4 
_t4 		blast with bubbles ?
_t4 
_t4 		we didn't know what the reaction would be says elephant handler Sean Graham who blew bubbles from a machine he brought inside the elephant barn . 
_t4 		five Asian elephants that Graham takes care of tore around chasing them like a bunch of excited kids . 
_t4 		they opened their mouths stuck out their tongues and tried to catch the bubbles  ! 
_t4 		do you think they would do that ? 
_t4 		can you imagine ? 
_t4 		they just like kids did .
_t4 
_t4 		look at .

_t4 		I think you had a cold did you have trouble sleeping last night ? 
_t4 		you kept gettin(g) up ? 
_t4 		is that (be)cause your nose was all stuffy ? 
_t4 		yeah ? 
_t4 		do you have a cold ?
_t4 
_t4 		like all spectacled bears boo+boo and Rosie go wild over fruit . 
_t4 		you might think they'd squabble over it but these two cooperate . 
_t4 		in the wild these bears browse for their food sniffing out the fruits they like to eat and climbing trees to get them . 
_t4 		so the zoo+keepers drilled holes in an empty five gallon jug and filled it with apples grapes and raisins . 
_t4 		to reach the food boo+boo and Rosie would have_to stand upright then spin the jug to make the food come out through the holes . 
_t4 		Rosie stood up to reach the apparatus right away to get at the yummy smelling fruit . 
_t4 		but boo+boo simply sniffed and then lay down under the climbing equipment with his paw out . 
_t4 		all he had to do was wait for the food Rosie dropped as she spun the tumbler . 
_t4 		I think he was capable of spinning the tumbler says Chris Waldren assistant curator of carnivores but he's clever enough that he gets her to do it . 
_t4 		which she did and still does every time . 
_t4 		Rosie does all the work and he gets all the treats . 
_t4 		I think they've come to some sort of agreement perhaps or maybe one of these days Rosie will wake up hungry as a bear and it will be every mammal for himself . 
_t4 		here's where they put the fruit see ? 
_t4 		yep [: yes] . 
_t4 		how come he doesn't do it ?
