_d3553 		soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels . 
_d3553 		we're going on a picnic said Bear come on . 
_d3553 		Franklin was worried his friends would make fun of his training wheels so he fibbed and said I'm not hungry and went home to eat lunch alone . 

_d3554 		he felt very unsteady and very unsure . 

_d3554 		riding a bicycle is difficult said his mother but you can't give up just because it's frustrating . 
_d3554 		it's too hard for me said Franklin it was easy for my friends . 
_d3554 		do you think everything comes easily for them she asked . 

_d3554 		Badger had spluttered and cried it took her a long time to feel good in the water . 

_d3555 		Franklin sat on his bike and his mother held on to the seat . 

_d3578 		the elephants trumpeted with their trunks , the monkeys jumped up and down , and the zebras stamped their hoofs with happiness . 
_d3578 		what animals do you see ? 
_d3578 		xxx you're right , where are the monkeys ? 
_d3578 		here they are , and what else do you see ? 
_d3578 		uh+huh .
_d3578 
_d3578 		and what else ? 
_d3578 		the elephants , and do you remember what this is ? 
_d3578 		what kind of animal is that ? 
_d3578 		think so . 
_d3578 		not far from the ceremony , in a cave at the back side of Pride rock , a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled , life's [: life is] not fair , I shall never be king . 
_d3578 		who's that ? 
_d3578 		moments later , Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave . 
_d3578 		Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba , he said . 
_d3578 		you should have been first in line . 
_d3578 		I was first in line until that little hair+ball was born , he said , and Scar stalked out of the cave . 
_d3578 		that's Zazu .
_d3578 
_d3578 		he's a bird , right ? 
_d3578 		uh+huh . 
_d3578 		before long , Simba grew into a healthy , playful young cub . 
_d3578 		early one morning , he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock . 
_d3578 		as they looked out at the rising sun , Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands . 
_d3578 		look Simba , he said , everything the light touches is our kingdom . 
_d3578 		Simba scanned the horizon and noticed a dark spot in the distance . 
_d3578 		what about that shadowy place ? 
_d3578 		that's beyond our borders , you must never go there Simba . 
_d3578 		but I thought a king can do whatever he wants . 
_d3578 		there's more to being king than getting your way all the time . 
_d3578 		everything you see exists together in a delicate balance . 
_d3578 		as king , you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures . 
_d3578 		from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope . 
_d3578 		we're all connected in the great Circle of life . 
_d3578 		later , as Simba headed back down the path , he ran into Scar . 
_d3578 		hey uncle Scar , guess what , I'm gonna be king of Pride rock . 
_d3578 		my dad showed me the whole kingdom , and I'm gonna rule it all . 
_d3578 		Scar looked slyly at the young cub . 
_d3578 		he didn't show you what's beyond that rise of the northern border . 
_d3578 		well no , he said I couldn't go there . 
_d3578 		oh he's right , it's far too dangerous . 
_d3578 		only the bravest lions go there . 
_d3578 		hello ? 
_d3578 		&er . 
_d3578 		come on , I just heard about this great place . 
_d3578 		the mothers gave permission for the youngsters to go , as long as Zazu went with them . 
_d3578 		Simba and Nala raced across the Pride lands in an effort to lose the watchful bird . 
_d3578 		they led him through many herds of animals until they finally lost him . 
_d3578 		once the cubs were free of Zazu , Simba pounced on Nala . 
_d3578 		then Nala flipped Simba onto his back . 
_d3578 		they tumbled down a hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones . 
_d3578 		Simba looked around and gasped . 
_d3578 		this is it , we made it ! 
_d3578 		but before the cubs could explore any farther , Zazu tracked them down . 
_d3578 		we're way beyond the boundary of the Pride lands , and right now , we are all in very real danger . 
_d3578 		xxx , who's that . 
_d3578 		who are those ? 
_d3578 		what kind of animals are they ?
_d3578

_d3578 
_d3578 		aren't they hyenas ?
_d3578 
_d3578 		yeah .
_d3578 
_d3578 		do hyenas laugh a lot ? 
_d3578 		yes .

_d3579 		why are you so , what's so silly ?
_d3579 
_d3579 		and the always laughing Ed . 
_d3579 		Banzai gra:bbed Zazu by the neck and plopped him down . 
_d3579 		xxx hyenas circled their prey , licking their chops . 
_d3579 		what's the hurry , we'd love you to stick around for dinner . 
_d3579 		while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom , Simba , Nala , and Zazu quickly slipped away . 
_d3579 		but the hyenas weren't distracted for long . 
_d3579 		they gave chase , and Simba and Nala had to run as fast as they could . 
_d3579 		finally they tried hiding behind some elephant bones . 
_d3579 		just when it looked as if it were all over for the young cubs , Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with one swipe of his big paw . 
_d3579 		if you ever come near my son again , he said . 
_d3579 		the hyenas slinked away and Mufasa glared at Simba . 
_d3579 		you deliberately disobeyed me , I'm very disappointed . 
_d3579 		Mufasa sent Nala and Zazu home so he could talk privately to his son . 
_d3579 		Simba peered up at his father . 
_d3579 		I was just trying to be brave , like you . 
_d3579 		well their home is back in the Pride lands , but right now they're just looking , at the ,  , at the stars , right ? 
_d3579 		sparkly ? 
_d3579 		do you still have all three rings ? 
_d3579 		mhm . 
_d3579 		wow , nice . 
_d3579 		Dad , we're pals , right , and we'll always be together , right , said Simba . 
_d3579 		Mufasa looked up at the stars . 
_d3579 		Simba , let me tell you something my father told me . 
_d3579 		look at the stars . 
_d3579 		great kings of the past look down on us from these stars . 
_d3579 		so whenever you feel alone , just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you , and so will I . 
_d3579 		meanwhile , the hyenas received another visitor . 
_d3579 		an angry Scar showed up at their lair . 
_d3579 		I practically gift+wrapped those cubs and you couldn't even dispose of them , he said . 
_d3579 		Scar warned the hyenas to be prepared . 
_d3579 		be prepared for what , Banzai laughed . 
_d3579 		for the death of the king , said Scar . 
_d3579 		the following day , Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge . 
_d3579 		when they arrived , Scar turned to his young nephew . 
_d3579 		now you wait here , your father has a marvelous surprise for you . 
_d3579 		well he has some hair on his head . 
_d3579 		mhm .
_d3579 
_d3579 		ah+hah ! 
_d3579 		Scar signaled the hyenas , who chased a herd of wildebeest directly towards Simba . 
_d3579 		they've just a tiny little tiny bit of hair . 
_d3579 		and ears , too , they have ears too , right ?
_d3579 
_d3579 		right . 
_d3579 		hmmm+hmmm+hmmm .
_d3579 
_d3579 		xxx goodness . 
_d3579 		from a distance , Mufasa noticed the rising dust . 
_d3579 		Scar appeared quickly at his side . 
_d3579 		stampede in the gorge , Simba's [: Simba is] down there ! 
_d3579 		without waiting a second , Mufasa took off to save his young son .
_d3579 
_d3579 		I guess he'd have_to jump . 
_d3579 		he found Simba , grabbed him the nape of his neck , and pulled him onto a nearby ledge . 
_d3579 		but suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede . 
_d3579 		desperately he tried to climb up another ledge from which Scar stood looking down on him . 
_d3579 		help me Brother , he said . 
_d3579 		Scar reached for Mufasa and pulled him close enough to whisper in his ear , long live the king , and let go of Mufasa . 
_d3579 		Simba peered over the ridge just as his father disappeared beneath the thundering stampede . 
_d3579 		later , Scar found Simba hovering over his father , sobbing . 
_d3579 		it was an accident , I didn't mean for it to happen . 
_d3579 		what am I going to do ? 
_d3579 		run away Simba , said Scar , run away and never return . 
_d3579 		Scar returned to Pride rock to take over the throne . 
_d3579 		meanwhile , Simba plodded across the Savanna without any food or water . 
_d3579 		it wasn't long before he fainted under the hot hot sun . 
_d3579 		he's so cute and all alone , can we keep him ? 
_d3579 		Pumbaa are you nuts , lions eat guys like us . 
_d3579 		but Pumbaa scooped Simba him up anyway and carried him to safety . 
_d3579 		when Simba awoke , the first thing that sprang to his mind was his father . 
_d3579 		you've got_to put your past behind you , he said , and that's exactly what Simba did . 
_d3579 		he stayed in the jungle with Pumbaa and Timon a long long time and grew into a very big lion . 
_d3579 		but eventually he got homesick . 
_d3579 		and one night he looked at the stars and recalled the words his father had told him a long time ago . 
_d3579 		who is that ? 
_d3579 		who's that ? 
_d3579 		it's Nala . 
_d3579 		Nala what are you doing here ? 
_d3579 		why didn't you come back to Pride rock , you're the king , she said . 
_d3579 		I'm not the king , Scar is . 
_d3579 		Simba , he let the hyenas take over the Pride lands , there's no food or water , and if you don't come back soon , everyone will be in trouble , you're our only hope ! 
_d3579 		I can't go back . 
_d3579 		Simba yelled at the heavens , you said you'd always be there for me but you're not . 
_d3579 		because of me . 
_d3579 		Simba didn't believe he could challenge Scar to the throne , so he stayed in the jungle with Nala and his new friends . 
_d3579 		but I knew the time had come for Simba to take his place in the circle of life , and I headed for the jungle . 
_d3579 		when Simba saw me , he was surprised . 
_d3579 		who are you ? 
_d3579 		question is , I asked , who are you ? 
_d3579 		I thought I knew , but now I'm not so sure . 
_d3579 		well I know who you are , you're Mufasa's boy . 
_d3579 		I led Simba to a reflecting pool . 
_d3579 		when he looked in the water he saw a lion . 
_d3579 		that's not my father , it's just my reflection . 
_d3579 		look harder , he lives in you , I said . 
_d3579 		the ghost of Mufasa magically appeared . 
_d3579 		look inside yourself Simba , you are more than what you have become . 
_d3579 		you must take your place in the Circle of life . 
_d3579 		that's the ghost of his father , of king Mufasa . 
_d3579 		yeah , well , scary , but he's still nice . 
_d3579 		he looks a little scary but he's still very nice . 
_d3579 		yeah . 
_d3579 		when Simba arrived back at Pride rock , he found the land bare and dry . 
_d3579 		the hyenas were in control and Scar was shouting at Simba's mother . 
_d3579 		suddenly , a flash of lightning revealed the edge of Pride rock , and there stood Simba . 
_d3579 		Scar jumped back . 
_d3579 		Simba , I'm a little surprised to see you , alive . 
_d3579 		give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart , said Simba . 
_d3579 		Scar started to slink off but he turned and lunged one last time at Simba . 
_d3579 		Simba moved quickly and flipped Scar over the edge where a pack of hyenas were waiting hungrily . 
_d3579 		limping badly , Simba climbed to the top of Pride rock . 
_d3579 		he let out a magnificent roar as he looked over his kingdom . 
_d3579 		before long , Pride rock flourished again . 
_d3579 		Nala remained by Simba's side and soon they had their own newborn cub . 
_d3579 		with their friends around , including Zazu , Pumbaa and Timon , a new celebration of life took place . 
_d3579 		after making a mark on the forehead of the young cub , I held him up for all the kingdom to see . 
