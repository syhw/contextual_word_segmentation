_t4 		it's    today is June twenty , June twenty+fifth . 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 		everybody's on .
_t4 		that's making a good noise . 
_t4 		and I'm gonna test the microphone by clicking the +... 
_t4 		cd player controls . 
_t4 		could hear those very well if this is working . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		hmmm , see how do I test hers .
_t4 		do you wanna put on the cd player ? 
_t4 		can you put it on ? 
_t4 		no ? 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		let's see , we gotta give her  .
_t4 		play baby .
_t4 		Mommy will play with you I just wanna get you some crunchy food . 
_t4 		can you come here for a second ? 
_t4 		oh that's a bowl . 
_t4 		would you like a crunchy piece of wheat ?
_t4 		no ?
_t4 		shoulda heard that  pretty loud if hers is working . 
_t4 		mmmm (o)kay . 
_t4 		xxx   ,  +//.
_t4 		boy that's stale +//.
_t4 		yuck . 
_t4 		mmmm+(o)kay . 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 		I am testing f+one . 
_t4 		if it's working +...
_t4 		you should be able to hear this very clearly . 
_t4 		that was the (.) cd player controls . 
_t4 		okay I'm gonna shut f+one off .
_t4 		no I'm not I'm gonna leave it on .
_t4 		xxx  turn on f+two .
_t4 		this is a test of the (.) transmitter that (.) I believe was not working .
_t4 		I'm close +//.
_t4 		I can't play right now because I'm figuring out this equipment .
_t4 		you've got a nice cup though .
_t4 		so I'm +//.
_t4 		so I've got it on f+one .
_t4 		I'll try it on f+two later .
_t4 		on the receiver of f+one and f+two are (.) on .
_t4 		but there is no +...
_t4 		I do not have the transmitter for f+two on .
_t4 		and I'm close to the camera now so I'm gonna walk outside (.) and if you can hear me then +...
_t4 		this transmitter is working .
_t4 		cause [: because] I'm gonna be talking constantly (.) and now I'm in the breeze+way (.) and now we're looking outside .
_t4 		right here .
_t4 		well and you definitely would not hear me without the microphone here . 
_t4 		so this transmitter itself is not the problem . 
_t4 		if this sound is working . 
_t4 		okay (.) now we're gonna go back . 
_t4 		and replay that . 
_t4 		okay (.) the only difference with this test is that +... 
_t4 		on the receiver (.) from the last session you just heard was that on the receiver +... 
_t4 		the f two switch is on off .
_t4 		rather than on on .
_t4 		and the other transmitter is still also off so +...
_t4 		you shouldn't be able to hear me +//.
_t4 		if I +...
_t4 		if you can hear me now then (.) then what then it makes no difference (.) whether the other transmitter is turned off on the receiver .
_t4 		look there's  .
_t4 		hi  . 
_t4 		hi . 
_t4 		xxx you gonna open the door for her ? 
_t4 		good job ! 
_t4 		thank you ! 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		how are you today ? 
_t4 		xxx  you ?
_t4 		okay tha(nks) .
_t4 		okay this is a test of +... 
_t4 		the transmitter which is on f+one right now . 
_t4 		and you definitely should not be able to hear this if there's a problem . 
_t4 		now this should be fine cause [: because] I just tested it . 
_t4 		xxx this is the one that I thought was not working because it had a new battery +... 
_t4 		but I did just change the battery , so it has a second new battery , which may have been the problem .
_t4 		and if you can hear this it's definitely fine . 
_t4 		kay [: okay] now I'm coming back to the camera . 
_t4 		I was in the other room . 
_t4 		and  now I  put on the one that's on f+two . 
_t4 		and walk into the other room . 
_t4 		what is +//. 
_t4 		xxx (.) and jiggling the camera seems to be there +//. 
_t4 		if I jiggle the camera a little +... 
_t4 		the green lights are on . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		the green lights are now on the receiver +//.
_t4 		they were kind of jiggling +... 
_t4 		um off and on to red . 
_t4 		which is bizarre in and of itself +//.
_t4 		it may be a separate problem . 
_t4 		and now with this transmitter on f+two +... 
_t4 		I'm going to walk away . 
_t4 		and if you can't hear this +... 
_t4 		at the same volume right now , then +... 
_t4 		receiver is not functioning properly . 
_t4 		right ? 
_t4 		okay stop . 
_t4 		okay a double test of the hypothesis that the f+two channel on the receiver is the malfunction . 
_t4 		I've just switched transmitters . 
_t4 		the one I have , I'm putting onto f+two . 
_t4 		both green lights on the receiver are on . 
_t4 		they're on green . 
_t4 		and I'm walking into the other room , speaking at the same tone of voice . 
_t4 		and you shouldn't be able , you should be able to +... 
_t4 		sounds like I'm getting louder and louder now , then the hypothesis is correct . 
_t4 		okay .
