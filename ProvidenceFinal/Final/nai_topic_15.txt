_t4 
_t4 		I am testing f+one . 
_t4 		if it's working +...
_t4 
_t4 		you should be able to hear this very clearly . 
_t4 		that was the (.) cd player controls . 
_t4 		okay I'm gonna shut f+one off .
_t4 
_t4 		no I'm not I'm gonna leave it on .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx  turn on f+two .

_t4 		so I've got it on f+one .
_t4 		I'll try it on f+two later .

_t4 
_t4 		but there is no +...
_t4 		I do not have the transmitter for f+two on .
_t4 		and I'm close to the camera now so I'm gonna walk outside (.) and if you can hear me then +...
_t4 		this transmitter is working .
_t4 		cause [: because] I'm gonna be talking constantly (.) and now I'm in the breeze+way (.) and now we're looking outside .
_t4 		right here .
_t4 		well and you definitely would not hear me without the microphone here . 
_t4 		so this transmitter itself is not the problem . 
_t4 		if this sound is working . 
_t4 		okay (.) now we're gonna go back . 
_t4 		and replay that . 
_t4 		okay (.) the only difference with this test is that +... 
_t4 		on the receiver (.) from the last session you just heard was that on the receiver +... 
_t4 		the f two switch is on off .
_t4 
_t4 		rather than on on .
_t4 
_t4 		and the other transmitter is still also off so +...
_t4 
_t4 		you shouldn't be able to hear me +//.
_t4 
_t4 		if I +...
_t4 
_t4 		if you can hear me now then (.) then what then it makes no difference (.) whether the other transmitter is turned off on the receiver .

_t4 		how are you today ? 
_t4 		xxx  you ?
_t4 
_t4 		okay tha(nks) .
_t4 
_t4 		okay this is a test of +... 
_t4 		the transmitter which is on f+one right now . 
_t4 		and you definitely should not be able to hear this if there's a problem . 
_t4 		now this should be fine cause [: because] I just tested it . 
_t4 		xxx this is the one that I thought was not working because it had a new battery +... 
_t4 		but I did just change the battery , so it has a second new battery , which may have been the problem .
_t4 		and if you can hear this it's definitely fine . 
_t4 		kay [: okay] now I'm coming back to the camera . 
_t4 		I was in the other room . 
_t4 		and  now I  put on the one that's on f+two . 
_t4 		and walk into the other room . 
_t4 		what is +//. 
_t4 		xxx (.) and jiggling the camera seems to be there +//. 
_t4 		if I jiggle the camera a little +... 
_t4 		the green lights are on . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		the green lights are now on the receiver +//.
_t4 
_t4 		they were kind of jiggling +... 
_t4 		um off and on to red . 
_t4 		which is bizarre in and of itself +//.
_t4 
_t4 		it may be a separate problem . 
_t4 		and now with this transmitter on f+two +... 
_t4 		I'm going to walk away . 
_t4 		and if you can't hear this +... 
_t4 		at the same volume right now , then +... 
_t4 		receiver is not functioning properly . 
_t4 		right ? 
_t4 		okay stop . 
_t4 		okay a double test of the hypothesis that the f+two channel on the receiver is the malfunction . 
_t4 		I've just switched transmitters . 
_t4 		the one I have , I'm putting onto f+two . 
_t4 		both green lights on the receiver are on . 
_t4 		they're on green . 
_t4 		and I'm walking into the other room , speaking at the same tone of voice . 
_t4 		and you shouldn't be able , you should be able to +... 
