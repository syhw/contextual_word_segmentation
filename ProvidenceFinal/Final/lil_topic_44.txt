_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		I thought you wanted to give it to me . 
_t4 		ooh , that's big , ooh    . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		the sound of a bell brought their gaze to the rooftops of a village below . 
_t4 		they could not see from so high above that the village had been through many hard times . 
_t4 		famine , floods , and war had made the villagers weary and untrusting of strangers . 
_t4 		they had even become suspicious of their neighbors . 
_t4 		the villagers worked hard , but only for themselves . 
_t4 		there was a farmer , a tea merchant , a scholar , a seamstress , a doctor , a carpenter , and many others . 
_t4 		but they had little to do with one another .
_t4 
_t4 		that's the farmer .
_t4 
_t4 		the tea merchant . 
_t4 		the scholar , which is like a teacher . 
_t4 		that's the carpenter . 
_t4 		the seamstress . 
_t4 		and the doctor . 
_t4 		when the monks reached the foot of the mountain , the villagers disappeared into their houses . 
_t4 		no one came to the gates to greet them . 
_t4 		and when the people saw them enter the village , they closed their windows tight . 
_t4 		the monks knocked on the door of the first house . 
_t4 		there was no answer . 
_t4 		then the house went dark . 
_t4 		they knocked on a second door and the same thing happened . 
_t4 		it happened again and again , from one house to the next . 
_t4 		these people do not know happiness , they all agreed . 
_t4 		but today , said Siew , his face as bright as the moon , we will show them how to make stone soup . 
_t4 		they gathered twigs and branches and made a fire . 
_t4 		they place a small tin pot on top , and filled it with water from the village well . 
_t4 		a brave little girl who had been watching came to them . 
_t4 		what are you doing , she asked . 
_t4 		we're gathering twigs , said Lok . 
_t4 		we're making a fire , said Hok . 
_t4 		we're making stone soup , and we need three round , smooth stones , said Siew . 
_t4 		the little girl helped the monks looked around the courtyard until they found just the right ones . 
_t4 		then they put them in the water to cook . 
_t4 		these stones will make excellent soup , said Siew . 
_t4 		but this very small pot won't make much , I'm afraid . 
_t4 		my mother has a bigger pot , said the girl . 
_t4 		the little girl ran home . 
_t4 		as she started to take her pot , her mother asked what she was doing . 
_t4 		the three strangers are making soup from stones , she said , they need our biggest pot . 
_t4 		the monks poked the coals . 
_t4 		as smoke drifted up , the neighbors peered out from their windows . 
_t4 		a fire and a huge pot in the middle of the village was a true curiosity . 
_t4 		of course , old style stone soup should be well seasoned with salt and pepper , said Hok . 
_t4 		that is true , said Lok , as he stirred the giant pot filled with water and stones . 
_t4 		but we have none . 
_t4 		I have some salt and pepper , said the scholar , his eyes big with curiousity . 
_t4 		he disappeared , and came back with salt and pepper , and even a few other spices . 
_t4 		Siew took a taste . 
_t4 		last time we had soup stones of this size and color , carrots made the broth very sweet . 
_t4 		carrots , said the woman , said a woman from the back , I may have a few carrots . 
_t4 		but just a few , and off she ran . 
_t4 		but she returned with as many carrots as she could carry , carry , as she dropped them into the pot . 
_t4 		think it's gonna be good ?
_t4 
_t4 		do you think it would be better with onions , asked Hok . 
_t4 		oh yes , maybe an onion would taste good , said a farmer , and he hurried off . 
_t4 		he returned in a moment with five big onions , and he dropped them into the bubbling soup . 
_t4 		now that's a fine soup , he said . 
_t4 		the villagers all nodded their heads , as the smell was very agreeable . 
_t4 		but if only we had some mushrooms , said Siew , rubbing his chin . 
_t4 		several villagers licked their lips . 
_t4 		a few dashed away and returned with fresh mushrooms , noodles , pea pods , and carrots . 
_t4 		oh , sorry , not carrots , cabbages . 
_t4 		we already have carrots , don't +..?
_t4 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		something magical began to happen among the villagers . 
_t4 		as each person opened their heart to give , the next person gave even more . 
_t4 		and as this happened , the soup grew richer , and smelled more delicious . 
_t4 		I imagine the emperor would suggest we had dumplings , said one villager . 
_t4 		and bean curds , said another . 
_t4 		and taro root and winter melon and baby corn , cried the other villagers . 
_t4 		garlic , ginger root , soy sauce , mini buds !
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		are we gonna put you in the soup ? 
_t4 		are you a Lily bud ?
_t4 
_t4 		you're just a Lily ? 
_t4 		you're a Lily kid .
_t4 
_t4 		do you think we could put you in the soup and eat you up cause [: because] you're so tasty ? 
_t4 		no ?
_t4 
_t4 		oh darn .
_t4 
_t4 		there goes my snack .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		you are so silly . 
_t4 		I have some , I have some , people cried out , and off they ran , returning with all they could carry . 
_t4 		the monks stirred , and the pot bubbled . 
_t4 		how good it smelled . 
_t4 		how good it would taste , how giving the villagers had become . 
_t4 		at last , the soup was ready . 
_t4 		the villagers gathered together . 
_t4 		everyone sat down to eat . 
_t4 		they had not been together for a feast like this for as long as anyone could remember . 
_t4 		after the banquet , they told stories , they sang songs , and they celebrated long into the night . 
_t4 		then they unlocked their doors and took the monks into their homes and gave them very comfortable places to sleep . 
_t4 		in the gentle spring morning , everyone gathered together near the willows to say farewell . 
_t4 		thank you for having us as your guests , said the monks , you have been most generous . 
_t4 		thank you , said the villagers , with the gifts you have given , we will always have plenty . 
_t4 		you have shown us that sharing makes us all richer . 
_t4 		and to think , said the monks , being happy is as simple as making stone soup . 
_t4 		read this part ? 
_t4 		stone soup has its traditional roots in European folklore , but there are many versions of the story . 
_t4 		from France , Sweden , Russia , England , Belgium , there are also related stories from Jamaica , about a soup making pot , and Korea , about a magic cake tree , and the Philippines , about a bill paying hat . 
_t4 		in this retelling , I took  took the traditional form of the stone soup story and set it in China . 
_t4 		I also used the Buddhist story tradition , where tricksters spread enlightenment , rather than seeking gain for themselves . 
_t4 		the characters , Hok , Lok , and Siew , are prominent in Chinese folklore . 
_t4 		they are three deities that bestow , health , wealth , and prosperity . 
_t4 		Hok symbolizes good fortune and prosperity . 
_t4 		Lok symbolizes good health , family happiness , and mutual love . 
_t4 		Siew symbolizes longevity , and he brings good health , and long life , free from stress and obstacles . 
_t4 		hmmm   . 
_t4 		thank you . 
_t4 		well I don't think I have more applesauce , but we can go to the supermarket and buy more later . 
_t4 		he he he .

_t4 		well how did that happen ? 
_t4 		oh my gosh , wow . 
_t4 		my father always told me to stay away from humans , but I was so curious about them . 
_t4 		one of my favorite things to do was to explore sunken ships . 
_t4 		my best friend , Flounder , and I found the most wonderful human treasures inside them . 
_t4 		Daddy said humans were cruel , but I knew that any creature who could make things as beautiful as those crea(tures) , as those treasures couldn't be all bad . 
_t4 		one day I found something amazing . 
_t4 		back then , I didn't know anything about the human world . 
_t4 		but our friend Scuttle , the seagull , did . 
_t4 		he told us it was a dingle+hopper and that humans used it to comb their hair . 
_t4 		was he right ?
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx , you're right , that is so silly .
_t4 
_t4 		then , Flounder and I swam to a secret cave where I kept my human treasures . 
_t4 		I turned on a music box and watched the tiny couple inside dance . 
_t4 		I wished I could dance and be part of the human world . 
_t4 		Flounder and I were arranging my treasures when a ship passed overhead . 
_t4 		we swam up to take a look . 
_t4 		suddenly , a storm blew in . 
_t4 		powerful waves pushed the ship closer to the rocks near the shore . 
_t4 		then , the human they called prince Eric fell overboard ! 
_t4 		I dove underwater to rescue him , and I was able to pull him to shore . 
_t4 		I had never been that close to a human before . 
_t4 		I couldn't take my eyes off of him . 
_t4 		I was so moved that I started to sing . 
_t4 		that's when eric opened his eyes . 
_t4 		we're going to forget this whole thing ever happened , he said . 
_t4 		later on , Daddy came into my secret cave . 
_t4 		Sebastian had told him everything . 
_t4 		Daddy was furious and lectured me about my responsibilities as a princess . 
_t4 		but I didn't want to be a princess , I wanted to be a human girl . 
_t4 		Daddy ordered me to stay away from humans , and I told him +/.

_t4 		oh my gosh , look at that .
_t4 
_t4 		ha  .
_t4 
_t4 		Daddy ordered me to stay away from the humans , but I told him I couldn't do that . 
_t4 		he lowered his trident , and with a single blast , destroyed all of my human treasures . 
_t4 		I put my head down and cried . 
_t4 		suddenly , I felt something brush up against my arm . 
_t4 		at my side were two eels that belonged to the sea witch , Ursula . 
_t4 		I had heard horrible stories about the sea witch , but I was so upset I didn't care . 
_t4 		uh  . 
_t4 		Ursula ? 
_t4 		not so nice . 
_t4 		mmmm+mmmm . 
_t4 		Ursula was very +... 
_t4 		creepy . 
_t4 		xxx , c:reepy .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx , she's so creepy ! 
_t4 		she offered to make me human for three days , if , I gave her my voice in exchange . 
_t4 		uh  , that doesn't look good .
_t4 
_t4 		she told me I would stay a human if prince Eric kissed me before the sunset on the third day .
_t4 
_t4 		don't what ? 
_t4 		oh . 
_t4 		uh  .
_t4 
_t4 		it doesn't look good .
_t4 
_t4 		I thought about what Daddy had said , but I was determined to see prince Eric again .
_t4 
_t4 		as soon as I signed the contract , my voice flowed into Ursula's seashell which was tied around her neck . 
_t4 		uh  .
_t4 
_t4 		things are getting worse and worse !
_t4 
_t4 		I sat in the water and stared at my new legs . 
_t4 		they were amazing . 
_t4 		when I stood up , I felt so heavy . 
_t4 		walking was very different from swimming or floating in the water . 
_t4 		I was really a human . 
_t4 		everyone disapproved of what I had done . 
_t4 		only Scuttle was excited for me . 
_t4 		Ursula is bad news , scolded Sebastian . 
_t4 		but it was too late for a warning . 
_t4 		my friends had to help me find the prince , if not , I'd become Ursula's slave ! 
_t4 		uh o:h .
_t4 
_t4 		this doesn't sound good .
_t4 
_t4 		I think we're gonna have a problem .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		luckily , prince Eric found me on the beach .
_t4 
_t4 		you seem very familiar , he said .
_t4 
_t4 		I wanted to tell him I was the one who had rescued him , but I couldn't speak . 
_t4 		he led me to his palace . 
_t4 		it felt strange to walk , but the prince held me tightly and helped me with each step . 
_t4 		his servant showed me to my room and I put on a pink gown . 
_t4 		at dinner , prince Eric told me I looked beautiful . 
_t4 		I smiled dreamily . 
_t4 		it seemed like everything was falling into place . 
_t4 		the next day , Eric and I went out on his rowboat . 
_t4 		Eric stopped the boat in a lagoon . 
_t4 		there , he leaned over to me , and just as we were about to kiss , splash ! 
_t4 		the boat flipped over . 
_t4 		the kiss would have_to wait . 
_t4 		oh no !
_t4 
_t4 		what are we g(onna) [: going to] +//.
_t4 
_t4 		uh  .
_t4 
_t4 		I awoke on the third day , happier than before , but when I saw Eric , he was with another woman called Vanessa ! 
_t4 		xxx  no !
_t4 
_t4 		what is going on ?
_t4 
_t4 		this does not look good !
_t4 
_t4 		I heard him say , our wedding ship departs at sunset . 
_t4 		I was crushed , Eric was going to marry Vanessa ! 
_t4 		what had gone wrong ? 
_t4 		what ? 
_t4 		I'd been certain that Eric had the same feelings for me as I did for him , but now it was too late !
_t4 
_t4 		but Scuttle flew over and said , I saw the bride in the mirror , Vanessa is Ursula in disguise .
_t4 
_t4 		egads .
_t4 
_t4 		now I understood , Ursula had tricked Eric into marrying her .
_t4 
_t4 		while Flounder pulled me onto the ship , Scuttle and some other sea creatures swam ahead and interrupted the wedding , dropping things on Vanessa and spraying her with water . 
_t4 		Scuttle snatched the necklace from Vanessa , which fell to the ground and shattered , and my voice flowed back to me . 
_t4 		and as loudly as I could , I yelled , Eric ! 
_t4 		you're the one , said Eric , it was you all the time . 
_t4 		Eric leaned in to kiss me . 
_t4 		it's too late , Vanessa shrieked . 
_t4 		the sun had just dropped below the horizon . 
_t4 		suddenly , as I changed back into a mermaid , Vanessa changed back into Ursula . 
_t4 		she is so creepy .
_t4 
_t4 		Ursula took me to my father and showed him the contract . 
_t4 		I might be willing to make an exchange , Ursula said , and Daddy agreed , and took my place as Ursula's slave . 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		it's so sad .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		what  gonna happen now ? 
_t4 		alright , let's see .
_t4 
_t4 		I had to save Daddy and the kingdom , so I followed Ursula . 
_t4 		oh no !
_t4 
_t4 		but while I distracted Ursula , Eric grabbed the wheel of the ship , and steered the bow right into Ursula's cold heart . 
_t4 		we had defeated the evil sea witch ! 
_t4 		yay !
_t4 
_t4 		oh look , what happens .
_t4 
_t4 		Daddy was free , and he forgave me for my selfishness . 
_t4 		he also realized how much I loved Eric . 
_t4 		he touched the water with his trident , and transformed my tail into legs again . 
_t4 		with his blessing , Eric and I were married , and lived happily ever after . 
_t4 		yay . 
_t4 		you want that one , or do you want Jessie ? 
_t4 		we haven't read Jessie in a while . 
_t4 		really ? 
_t4 		what's this about ?

_t4 
_t4 		oh , great .
_t4

_t4 		don't get me wrong , I like being a princess , but to be honest with you , I'd rather play around and be a member of my blueberry troupe than perform royal duties . 

_t4 		however , she's a whole lot better than she used to be , I'll tell you that much . 

_t4 		we were all terrified of those grasshoppers . 
_t4 		they barely left us enough food for ourselves in the winter . 
_t4 		poor Adda , I have_to admit , she was stepping up to the throne at a bad time . 
_t4 		he is an inventor , and let me tell you , he can invent anything . 
_t4 		once , he made a telescope out of a drop of water that he put inside a rolled up leaf . 

_t4 		in a balloon !
_t4 
_t4 		well you just feel like I guess the physics of it because like the heat rises and whatever that it's so simple that unless like you know some flying knife comes out and hits your balloon like that there's just not that much that can go assuming you're not (be)cause they do weather reporting so you're not gonna get hopefully caught in a thunderstorm or whatever . 

_t4 
_t4 		oh hot springs you can but those are all like a hundred and five to a hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit .

_t4 		mhm .
_t4 
_t4 		alright , we 
_t4 		(o)kay . 
_t4 		great , who lives in New york ? 
_t4 		well who lives in New york , since we're reading about New york ? 
_t4 		and who else ? 
_t4 		uh huh ?
_t4 
_t4 		that's right , they all live in New york .
_t4 
_t4 		do you know where Grandma  told me that she and Papa  were going ?
_t4 
_t4 		they're going to Greece . 
_t4 		yeah , that'd [: that would] be fun , it's very far away . 
_t4 		you wanna go with me one day ? 
_t4 		(o)kay , they're going to a wedding ! 
_t4 		exciting ,  ? 
_t4 		my name is Becky , and I live near the New york public library . 
_t4 		some buildings in New york make you feel small . 
_t4 		but walking up the steps of the library makes me feel important . 
_t4 		we should go to the library next time we're in . 
_t4 		wouldn't that be a great idea ? 
_t4 		it's like walking up the steps of a palace , especially if you walk exactly in the middle . 
_t4 		xxx all the people . 
_t4 		the library was my favorite place in New york when we first moved here . 
_t4 		my mother painted me a map . 
_t4 		you can see it in the front of this book . 
_t4 		here it is . 
_t4 		she's an artist and she painted all the other pictures too . 
_t4 		she said that once a week , we could go wherever I wanted to . 
_t4 		if I could figure out how to get there . 
_t4 		for my first expedition , I wanted to see real animals . 
_t4 		finding a zoo on the map was easy . 
_t4 		knowing where I was on the map , and which way to walk to the zoo was a little harder . 
_t4 		but I finally figured it out by turning the map . 
_t4 		once the map and I were both facing the same direction , finding the zoo was easy . 
_t4 		have you been to the zoo ? 
_t4 		yes you have . 
_t4 		one good thing about New york is that most of the streets are numbered in order . 
_t4 		the numbers go up as you go north , and down as you go south . 
_t4 		it's very logical . 
_t4 		so we just walked straight on fifth avenue . 
_t4 		I know I was going the right way because the numbers kept going up . 
_t4 		and at sixty+fourth street , we turned left . 
_t4 		sometimes zoos make you feel sorry for the animals that live in them , but at this one , most of the animals aren't in cages . 
_t4 		the penguins have rocks to climb on , and make their nests with , and a pool to swim in . 
_t4 		you can stand right next to the glass and see under the water ! 
_t4 		they were my favorites , but I also liked watching the insects . 
_t4 		I saw a leaf cutter ant , bite off a leaf and carry it all the way back to its nest . 
_t4 		what was your favorite thing at the zoo , do you remember ? 
_t4 		yeah , do you remember the polar bears ? 
_t4 		wasn't there a polar bear named Lily ? 
_t4 		that's pretty neat , huh ? 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		tell me if you want me to take your plate , okay ? 
_t4 		do you want me to take it ? 
_t4 		no ? 
_t4 		yes ? 
_t4 		I'm just gonna put it over here , okay ? 
_t4 		while I take a sip of my coffee . 
_t4 		wow , what's this ? 
_t4 		a ferris wheel ? 
_t4 		oh a carousel , yes it's true .
_t4 
_t4 		after the zoo , we explored the park and found a carousel . 
_t4 		I chose a big black horse with a lion saddle . 
_t4 		it wasn't like riding a real horse but it was kind of fun anyway . 
_t4 		the horse went up and down when the music started . 
_t4 		I had three rides . 
_t4 		I thought that was a silly name for a big black horse with a roaring lion saddle . 
_t4 		hmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		when I wanted to get a birthday present for my friend Martin , my parents said they were going to the twenty+sixth street antiques fair , and that I could look for one there . 
_t4 		they had a lot of antique toys , like a china dog and a wooden horse , but I didn't think Martin would really like those . 
_t4 		I did find him some old baseball cards for his collection though . 
_t4 		Mommy used to work right around here . 
_t4 		it's true . 
_t4 		yeah , the twenties . 
_t4 		who loves cheesecake ?
_t4 
_t4 		I do love cheesecake , hmmm+hmmm ! 
_t4 		my mother said they had the best cheesecake in New york . 
_t4 		his grandchildren work there , in little aprons . 
_t4 		dogs were everywhere , because a fancy dog show was going on across the street . 
_t4 		I like the dobermans , and a little black bulldog . 
_t4 		there's the dobermans , and there's the little black bulldog I guess . 
_t4 		oh ,  , I think that is a cat . 
_t4 		where's the little black bulldog , I wonder ? 
_t4 		xxx , have you and Daddy already discussed this ?
_t4 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		no ?
_t4 
_t4 		that one's [: one is] not a bulldog , you're right .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx , thanks for setting me straight on that one , Sweetie . 
_t4 		yeah ,  . 
_t4 		yes , Honey ? 
_t4 		you want some more strawberries ? 
_t4 		should I get them now , or should I read some more first ? 
_t4 		read some more first ? 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		do you know what this is ? 
_t4 		is it a big boat ?
_t4 
_t4 		what's it called ? 
_t4 		after cheesecake , we went to the Intrepid . 
_t4 		you can see where kamikaze planes crashed into it . 
_t4 		yikes . 
_t4 		the fighter jets are real too , you can climb up platforms and look inside them . 
_t4 		it was a very cold , windy day , and we had the whole huge deck almost to ourselves . 
_t4 		Martin ran around acting and sounding like a plane until other people came out , so then we went inside . 
_t4 		we got_to work the controls in the simulated cockpit with pilot and copilot seats . 
_t4 		and Martin loved it . 
_t4 		uh . 
_t4 		woo . 
_t4 		look at that , do you remember what the name of that building is ?
_t4 
_t4 		that's the Empire state building .
_t4 
_t4 		the next week we went to the observation deck of the Empire state building . 
_t4 		we stepped onto it just at that magical moment when the city and bridge lights are on , but the sky still has some of the sunset in it and it's not quite dark . 
_t4 		you could see so far . 
_t4 		in the painting we are looking north , with the Hudson river on our left and the East river on our right . 
_t4 		the small green square in the distance is Central park . 
_t4 		here we go , wow . 
_t4 		ah , look , there's Central park . 
_t4 		yup [: yes] . 
_t4 		mhm ?
_t4 
_t4 		that's the Hudson river , and the East river . 
_t4 		some birds flying . 
_t4 		Martin's mother was curious about these expeditions of ours , so for our next one , we went to Wall street , where she works . 
_t4 		we met her on the spot where george Washington was sworn in as our first president . 
_t4 		do you remember where you saw a thing about george Washington ? 
_t4 		Liberty's kids , right .
_t4 
_t4 		do you know who used to work right around Wall street ? 
_t4 		actually , who used to work on Wall street ? 
_t4 		that's right , Daddy used to work on Wall street . 
_t4 		mhm , it's true .
_t4 
_t4 		your daddy .
_t4 
_t4 		in the federal hall national memorial museum , behind the statue , I learned +/.
_t4 
_t4 		mhm ?
_t4 
_t4 		you want more strawberries now ?
_t4 
_t4 		(o)kay . 
_t4 		let me get them for you . 
_t4 		careful of my coffee , okay baby+cakes ?
_t4 
_t4 		oh , I knocked my  microphone off ,   . 
_t4 		whoops ! 
_t4 		xxx put that back on .

_t4 		okay . 

_t4 		you're welcome , Sweetie . 
_t4 		where were we ? 
_t4 		oh+my+goodness , I keep losing my microphone . 
_t4 		what were we reading about ?
_t4 
_t4 		ok , (o)kay . 
_t4 		after that , we took the subway to my favorite toystore , f a o Schwartz . 
_t4 		they have more stuffed animals than I'd ever seen in my life . 
_t4 		and they really are as big as my mother has painted them ! 
_t4 		she let Martin and me paint ourselves into this picture . 
_t4 		can you tell which are our self+portraits ? 
_t4 		let's see .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx , there they are ! 

_t4 		that looks like a kid drew it , don't you think ? 
_t4 		yeah , heh+heh ! 
_t4 		that's funny . 
_t4 		I said I thought they should have toys designed by children , so she let me paint those in too . 
_t4 		guess which toys I made up . 
_t4 		the answer's [: answer is] at the end of the book . 
_t4 		let's see . 

_t4 		let's see ,  , here we go . 
_t4 		heh  , here they are . 
_t4 		that's funny .
_t4 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		on the fourth of July , we went to the harbor . 
_t4 		we saw buildings from before the revolution , and a little lighthouse memorial to the Titanic . 
_t4 		it has a ball on top that drops down exactly at noon . 
_t4 		sailors used to set their clocks by it . 
_t4 		then we took a boat to the statue of liberty . 
_t4 		we stopped at Ellis island , where immigrants used to land when they came to the new  +/.
_t4 
_t4 		you did , where did you see it ?
_t4 
_t4 		you and Daddy saw it ? 
_t4 		when you went on the Staten island ferry ?
_t4

_t4 
_t4 		how special , huh ? 

_t4 
_t4 		ooh ! 
_t4 		just before school started , we spent the whole day playing in Central park , where a kid told us that grand central has a whispering room . 
_t4 		he said if we stood in opposite corners and whispered into them , we'd be able to hear each other perfectly , but no one else could . 
_t4 		so of course we wanted to try it . 
