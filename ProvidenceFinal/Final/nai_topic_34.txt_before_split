_t4 		it's still snowing out , look . 
_t4 		you can see some snow falling still . 
_t4 		(be)cause the lights aren't on . 
_t4 		and it's a dark day , it's not a sunny day . 
_t4 		all+right , here we are ! 
_t4 		oh , there are two tables see ! 
_t4 		one on that side +... 
_t4 		and one on that side . 
_t4 		and there are two lamps too .
_t4 
_t4 		you could do that . 
_t4 		and there's the chair in the guest bedroom also .
_t4

_t4 		okay , i'll move the microphone then . 
_t4 		okay , just a sec(ond) . 
_t4 		all+right . 
_t4 		all+right . 
_t4 		you don't have_to inhale it . 
_t4 		let's go upstairs . 
_t4 		inhale means to breathe . 
_t4 		you looked like you were breathing in the microphone . 
_t4 		I don't know . 
_t4 		oh , that's what you were doing . 
_t4 		yes ,  you're in luck . 
_t4 		Naima , I'm gonna check and see if there's any laundry I need doing , I'll be right back . 
_t4 		just to the washing machine . 
_t4 		hi . 

_t4 		oh Naima .
_t4 
_t4 		all+right , where is it honey ?
_t4 
_t4 		on the floor , okay . 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		you wanna do the painting now ? 
_t4 		because I thought that it might be easier if I give you one color and then another and then another . 
_t4 		because that way the colors you won't get all  , all mixed up on the brush . 
_t4 		which is what sometimes happens . 
_t4 		well , there's actually some water right there . 
_t4 		and there's also some on top , so there's some in there +... 
_t4 		yeah , ooh . 
_t4 		yeah , of course not , you can take as long as you want . 
_t4 		thank you sweetie . 
_t4 		you can let me know if you decide you want another color . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		which color would you like next ? 
_t4 		umm purple , green , blue , orange , red . 
_t4 		brown . 
_t4 		you want brown , okay . 
_t4 		I'll get you brown . 
_t4 		and then after you're done with brown you can pick out another color . 
_t4 		there's red .
_t4 
_t4 		he says wed with a w .
_t4 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		Wodney wat . 
_t4 		some toddlers can't . 
_t4 		well because even when you're a little kid you're still learning how to talk , aren't ya [: you] ? 
_t4 		it's not so easy . 
_t4 		to learn how to talk ? 
_t4 		it's a very difficult thing . 
_t4 		yup [: yes] , that's another way you can do it all+right . 
_t4 		oh , what color would you like next ? 
_t4 		&er wed , or red ? 
_t4 		red .
_t4 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		let me have that brush . 
_t4 		and I will get you the red now . 
_t4 		do you like that Wodney wat story ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		why does the title of the book say Wodney wat instead of Rodney rat ? 
_t4 		the title of the book uses +...
_t4 
_t4 		the way Wodney says his name . 
_t4 		because it's about him it doesn't use +... 
_t4 		what probably his parents probably say Rodney rat , right ?
_t4 
_t4 		well they aren't toddlers , they probably can pronounce their r's .
_t4 
_t4 		properly .
_t4 
_t4 		well , grown+ups usually can pronounce things . 
_t4 		it's just that when you're little and growing up , some things are hard to pronounce . 
_t4 		it's hard to twist your mouth in that just+the+right way . 
_t4 		don't you think ? 
_t4 		do you think it's hard to say some words ? 
_t4 		what words do you think it's hard to say ? 
_t4 		there's water right in there . 
_t4 		yup [: yes] , the paint gets into the water and colors the water red . 
_t4 		he does ?
_t4 
_t4 		he can't ?
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm +... 
_t4 		the hairs keep all the dirt out . 
_t4 		and other things from getting up into your nose and your throat . 
_t4 		well if you didn't have all the little hairs in your nose , then you might get big pieces of dust or little pieces of dirt up in your throat . 
_t4 		(be)cause your nose is actually connected to your throat . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 
_t4 		with a tail ! 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 
_t4 		oh my .
_t4 
_t4 		a blue ear above ?
_t4 
_t4 		blue air above ,  , like sky you mean ? 
_t4 		here's some black . 
_t4 		yeah I gave you a different brush (be)cause the other one it looked like the pieces of the brush were coming out on your paper because you were banging the brush on the paper , see how there's little pieces of brush on your paper ?
_t4 
_t4 		on your painting ? 
_t4 		what things are black ? 
_t4 		well sometimes the sky can look black if there's a storm coming . 
_t4 		it's usually a very , very dark grey not actually black . 
_t4 		but at night sometimes the sky can look black . 
_t4 		when it's nighttime . 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		the animal eats the black thing ? 
_t4 		oh . 
_t4 		that's all+right . 
_t4 		I'll clean it up . 
_t4 		when you're done with the painting . 
_t4 		oh . 
_t4 		oh , the black stuff is stuff inside the animal's nose .
_t4 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 
_t4 		which pink part ? 
_t4 		oh . 
_t4 		that's where its nose is ? 
_t4 		huh . 
_t4 		uh+huh . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		oh , so the sky has dark parts and blue parts ?
_t4 
_t4 		wow , look at all the snow in the sky right now .
_t4 
_t4 		my+goodness ! 
_t4 		it's really snowin [: snowing] . 
_t4 		you want some blue now ? 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		should I take that ? 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		that's part of the sky ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		it's getting to be dark , yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		um I think the , you haven't had the green or the orange or the purple , but you've had the other colors . 
_t4 		yeah okay , hold on .
_t4 
_t4 		what do you think sometimes is +/?
_t4 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		funny shaped grapes ?
_t4 
_t4 		that are not good to eat ? 
_t4 		oh that are good to eat .
_t4 
_t4 		sometimes the sky can be purple , what other things are purple ?
_t4 
_t4 		the sky can be purple+ish if there's a nice sunset . 
_t4 		and some flowers are purple . 
_t4 		let's see +... 
_t4 		let me get you the purple . 
_t4 		are you all done with the blue ? 
_t4 		do you want me to get the purple or are you still painting with the blue ? 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		do you want me to get the purple for you ? 
_t4 		when you're done with that +...
_t4 
_t4 		yup [: yes] , you can call them pictures or paintings . 
_t4 		yup [: yes] !
_t4 
_t4 		well they're pictures . 
_t4 		you could say your painting a picture or you could say your painting a painting . 
_t4 		(be)cause painting means what you're doing , but it also means what it is you painted . 
_t4 		yeah , I think that's probably what we say in this house , we say you're painting a painting . 
_t4 		or your painting a picture . 
_t4 		I guess maybe we say both . 
_t4 		here is the purple . 
_t4 		sky can be purple sometimes if there is sunset . 
_t4 		and it's more that it's purplish , it's not usually bright purple . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		oh boy . 
_t4 		are you done with the purple ? 
_t4 		you wanna keep the purple there and I'll give you some orange ? 
_t4 		I'll give you a separate , I'll give you a different +... 
_t4 		brush for the orange , so that the orange and the purple don't get all mixed together . 
_t4 		so I'll put the orange all the way over here , let me get some water for that . 
_t4 		let's see +... 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		now I'll actually move this down here since you're mostly done with the purple . 
_t4 		now you can use the brush for the orange . 
_t4 		oh , sun .
_t4 
_t4 		yes , sometimes it is !
_t4 
_t4 		well +... 
_t4 		usually it's part of a sunrise colors or sunset colors you can see orange . 
_t4 		I think green is the only one you haven't had . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		don't paint on the table please . 
_t4 		you can use this brush for the green . 
_t4 		can you think of anything ? 
_t4 		no ? 
_t4 		when you go outside what things do you see that are green outside ? 
_t4 		ahh , yes . 
_t4 		grass . 
_t4 		yes .
_t4 
_t4 		would you like another piece of paper ? 
_t4 		you mean you're done painting that one ? 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		wow . 
_t4 		oh , all+right .
_t4 
_t4 		do you need a little water next to the green ? 
_t4 		looks like it . 
_t4 		here . 
_t4 		oop(s) , a little too much ! 
_t4 		that's for me ? 
_t4 		yay .
_t4 
_t4 		I'm gonna come look at it . 
_t4 		do you want me to write anything on it or do you wanna just leave it without any writing on it ? 
_t4 		would you like another piece of paper ?
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm +... 
_t4 		mmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		yeah , it needs sometime to dry . 
_t4 		lemme [: let me] get you some paper . 
_t4 		I'm gonna get you a smaller piece this time . 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		so now you have three colors . 
_t4 		you have orange , green and purple all together there . 
_t4 		well , so that you don't mix the colors up . 
_t4 		if you use one brush for the orange and then you use the same brush for the green +...
_t4 
_t4 		the colors will mix+up and probably become some version of brown . 
_t4 		sometimes you wanna do that , but you may not wanna [: want to] do that all the time . 
_t4 		so this way you can use more than one brush . 
_t4 		one for each color if you want to . 
_t4 		uh+huh .
_t4 
_t4 		ahh .
_t4 
_t4 		and what color are you finding that you make when you do that ? 
_t4 		what would you call the combination color ? 
_t4 		I was peeling carrots , and slicing them . 
_t4 		woo+peeling them ?
_t4 
_t4 		no , I was actually peeling them . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		making some lines +... 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		well , when he comes home you can tell him about combining the colors . 
_t4 		it's seems like I do get a picture , almost every day you've given me one . 
_t4 		it's very nice to have them . 
_t4 		really ? 
_t4 		he's at work . 
_t4 		you know , those brushes really are shedding their , their brush , their +... 
_t4 		these aren't very good brushes . 
_t4 		(be)cause they're just coming out . 
_t4 		the  bristles , these are called the bristles . 
_t4 		the bristles just are coming right out . 
_t4 		are you done with this one , do you want me to put it aside ? 
_t4 		do you want any writing on it ? 
_t4 		mmmm+kay . 
_t4 		you wanna write with a different , with a pen or a crayon or something ? 
_t4 		you can write letters with paint . 
_t4 		do you wanna try that ? 

_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		don't talk to me like that please .
_t4 
_t4 		I'm coming , I'm gonna turn off the receivers and the camera the transmitters and the camera now , okay .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		uh , I think I have_to open the door .
_t4 
_t4 		the (.)  barn into the veterinary hospital ? 
_t4 		can we take some of the animals out to make special stalls for the sick animals ? 
_t4 		what do you think ? 
_t4 		let's [: let us] take them out so that there's room for the +//.
_t4 
_t4 		yes I know .
_t4 
_t4 		I know . 
_t4 		that's what he's doing right now . 
_t4 		why don't you take the animals out and we'll have a veterinary hospital in the barn ? 
_t4 		and +//.
_t4 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		oh ,  !
_t4 
_t4 		you mean like a (.) i+v fluid is what you mean . 
_t4 		o:h , great idea . 
_t4 		yep [: yes] , animals might need special water . 
_t4 		oh is that (.)  (.) bees+wax ? 
_t4 		I'm making more room on the floor and taking down the trains . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		it might be hard to get that out actually . 
_t4 		do you want that to come out ? 
_t4 		do you want me to help you ? 
_t4 		I think we need something to take it out , like a chopstick or something very narrow that could poke it out .
_t4 
_t4 		I might need a special tool to take out that wax . 
_t4 		no , something very narrow . 
_t4 		like a pen even , or +... 
_t4 		something very small . 
_t4 		oh , you took it out ! 
_t4 		oh no , there's still a little bit in there . 
_t4 		good , it's not soft right now .
_t4 
_t4 		there . 
_t4 		now it's all out .
_t4 
_t4 		should I take that ? 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		great . 
_t4 		&u:h , so +... 
_t4 		the tree's [: tree is] gonna be the treadmill at the veterinary hospital ?
_t4 
_t4 		o:h .
_t4 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		Pushpa is the veterinarian , okay .
_t4 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		that's a good question . 
_t4 		I think so .
_t4 
_t4 		that tree is a painted tree . 
_t4 		that , I think , is a willow tree , isn't it ?
_t4 
_t4 		it's a certain kind of a tree that grows near the water . 
_t4 		and what ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		it could be growing near the pond at the farm . 
_t4 		mmmm , to hold the base of the tree . 
_t4 		well , there's two pieces of wood making up that tree . 
_t4 		there's this part , and there's this part , and this is attached to this with the screws .
_t4 
_t4 		I think it's supposed to be the grass under the tree . 
_t4 		I think that's what that's supposed to be . 
_t4 		yeah ?
_t4 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		okay , here's the doctor . 
_t4 		oh , he's the veterinarian ?
_t4 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] see . 
_t4 		who's going to bring the sick animal ? 
_t4 		who's the sick animal now ? 
_t4 		which +//?
_t4 
_t4 		all of them ? 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		well , in the morning the doctors probably have_to do their rounds . 
_t4 		that means they visit all the sick patients .
_t4 
_t4 		oh , so what happens at nighttime at the veterinary hospital ? 
_t4 		curl up ? 
_t4 		her mother is a doctor ? 
_t4 		I'll be right back . 
_t4 		I'm gonna look something up , Naima . 
_t4 		so , only about five minutes has elapsed since I stopped recording . 
_t4 		when I played it back I heard a little interference that then went away , so I'm hoping it's not major interference . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		let's see what's happening with these animals .
_t4 
_t4 		yeah ?
_t4 
_t4 		o:h .
_t4 
_t4 		okay , that's the receipt .
_t4 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		okay , we can play that when we get home from gym class , sure .
_t4 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		do you want to keep playing  veterinary hospital now ? 
_t4 		all+right . 
_t4 		all+right o:h , is this a sick mouse ? 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		where's the veterinarian ?

_t4 		I think this this person is gonna bring the mouse into the veterinary hospital .
_t4 
_t4 		well , I'm bringing this mouse , which is sick , to the doctor and say this mouse seems to have a hurt tail . 
_t4 		this is my pet mouse , and it has a hurt tail .
_t4 
_t4 		can you examine (.) my mouse and figure out what the problem is with the tail ?
_t4 
_t4 		and maybe bandage the tail ?
_t4 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		there's not even  +//.
_t4 
_t4 		you mean which door is for which stall ? 
_t4 		oh it's hard when they're open to figure it out , isn't it ? 
_t4 		these are the stalls that are veterinary hospital . 
_t4 		is this the  veterinary hospital ? 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		okay , does the mouse need some medicine ? 
_t4 		and who else is an animal who's [: who is] gonna be brought to the veterinary hospital ? 
_t4 		this little cow hit its ear on a speaker at the concert ? 
_t4 		o:h . 
_t4 		well maybe this little calf needs its ear examined . 
_t4 		and the mother is coming along with it to keep it company . 
_t4 		and here's the doctor .
_t4 
_t4 		what does the doctor say ?
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm .

_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		goodby:e . 
_t4 		goodbye . 
_t4 		there's a stall for you I think , where you can be while you're getting better here at the veterinary hospital . 
_t4 		a colt ? 
_t4 		it hit its nose on Pushpa ? 
_t4 		o:h .
_t4 
_t4 		does it need a nose bandage ? 
_t4 		oh , dear . 
_t4 		that's quite +//. 
_t4 		is that something like a concert injury ?
_t4 
_t4 		I see .
_t4 
_t4 		oh , and my horse and my colt are here at the veterinary hospital , too . 
_t4 		and I know they will take good care of them , so I will go back to the farm and do farm+work while they are here being (.) treated by the veterinarians .
_t4 
_t4 		treated well by the veterinarians . 
_t4 		okay , I've [: I have] got_to go back and feed my other animals here . 
_t4 		the veterinary hospital could have a barn cat , who lives here , who isn't sick who just lives here all the time . 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		what's wrong with the cat ? 
_t4 		it licked too much milk ?
_t4 
_t4 		oh .

_t4 		I see . 
_t4 		o:h .
_t4 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		Pushpa , what are you going to do ? 

_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		you can't do it ? 

_t4 		oh .
_t4 
_t4 		shall we get some medicine made out of bees+wax up here ? 
_t4 		here's some cat medicine . 
_t4 		when cats get upset tummies , they can have that kind of medicine . 
_t4 		cause that's the +//. 
_t4 		that's how it normally is .
_t4 
_t4 		once I warmed it up in the oven and it all melted together and all the colors ran together .
_t4 
_t4 		and  came that time . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		are you gonna warm it up right there ?

_t4 
_t4 		in the night ?
_t4 
_t4 		you mean when it falls out of my clothes ? 

_t4 		cause otherwise we're gonna miss it .
_t4 
_t4 		very soon , though . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] play this for five more minutes and then we'll get on (.) some +//. 
_t4 		you could even wear your leotard if you want to .
_t4 
_t4 		would you like that ?
_t4 
_t4 		what else happens at a veterinary hospital ? 
_t4 		do the animals that are patients there get fed every day ?
_t4 
_t4 		you think so ?
_t4 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 
_t4 		but when they're sick they can't eat ? 
_t4 		are they gonna get some special water ? 
_t4 		do any of them need i+v fluids ?

_t4 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		good !

_t4 		oh , you're right , baby cows don't have udders .
_t4 
_t4 		calves don't have udders . 
_t4 		maybe I could make a milking pail (.) out of bees+wax .
_t4 
_t4 		the animals are  . 
_t4 		oh , there's a price tag on this .
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm . 

_t4 		um , some farm animals like to eat things like corn cobs , from corn+on+the+cob , leftover cobs . 

_t4 
_t4 		about five six seven hours of work , so I'm gonna do +//.
_t4 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		probably an hour+and+a+half , be home by five+thirty , six .
_t4 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		here's a corn cob .
_t4 
_t4 		one of the animals can eat the corn cob . 
_t4 		you know , we could look up which animals eat corn cobs . 
_t4 		I know that pigs like them .
_t4 
_t4 		I'm not sure if horses are allowed to eat corn cobs or not . 
_t4 		we could look that up .
_t4 
_t4 		why , you're right , it's not very soft , cause I didn't put this one in my bra . 
_t4 		I'm trying to make these without doing that . 
_t4 		I was gonna make a milking pail with the black bees+wax . 
_t4 		is it ? 
_t4 		no .
_t4 
_t4 		that one wasn't . 
_t4 		here , you can roll it just the way you roll play+doh . 

_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		xxx , if you hold them in your hand even for a little while , it will get , actually +... 
_t4 		I've actually started putting things in here , in my (.) in the waist of my pants . 
_t4 		I think that's pretty hard . 
_t4 		is it ?
_t4 
_t4 		maybe cause it's been in your hand for a little while . 
_t4 		whose job is it to feed the animals (.) at your farm ? 
_t4 		it's his job ? 
_t4 		oh , the baby doesn't belong there .
_t4 
_t4 		why don't you put the baby in the cradle ? 
_t4 		put it there , or in your bed maybe . 
_t4 		an unmouthed baby ? 
_t4 		cause it doesn't have a mouth ? 
_t4 		xxx , I think that's just so that you can imagine the mouth that it has . 
_t4 		sometimes it takes a while for these things to warm up . 
_t4 		I was just handling that one . 
_t4 		I just made that corn cob .
_t4 
_t4 		I was gonna make the pail now . 
_t4 		you were handling that ?
_t4 
_t4 		and it got warm ? 
_t4 		no I wasn't , but that's a very thin piece , so it probably wouldn't take much to warm it . 
_t4 		put it against your belly and see if it warms up quickly .
_t4 
_t4 		hold it with your palm and see if it gets softer . 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4

_t4 		well , not if you're gonna squeeze it .
_t4 
_t4 		otherwise you could have used it to put the milk in .
_t4 
_t4 		yes , I just made that pail that you are smashing with your fingers (.) with great glee . 
_t4 		are you smashing it with glee ? 
_t4 		hmmm .
