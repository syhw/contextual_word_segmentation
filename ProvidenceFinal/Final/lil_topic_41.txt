_t4 		Snuffy's favorite color . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		everyone sand a song about his or her favorite color . 
_t4 		but Snuffy couldn't decide what his favorite color was so he sang a song about all the colors . 
_t4 		concert day was supersonic said Jay Jay as he flew up next to Snuffy . 
_t4 		your rainbow song was the best part of the show . 
_t4 		you must be feeling pretty good . 
_t4 		I am said Snuffy but everyone else picked a favorite color to sing about and I couldn't figure out my favorite color . 
_t4 		choosing a favorite color is one of the hardest things I'd ever tried to do . 
_t4 		hey Snuffy said Jay Jay I have an idea when I have trouble figuring something out I go see Brenda Blue . 
_t4 		that's a great idea thanks Jay Jay called Snuffy . 
_t4 		he headed toward Terrytown airport and Brenda Blue's workshop . 
_t4 		when Snuffy arrived at the workshop he found Brenda Blue working on a small motor . 
_t4 		hi Brenda said Snuffy hi Snuffy what's wrong asked Brenda . 
_t4 		I can't decide on a favorite color said Snuffy . 
_t4 		well it seems to me if something is your favorite color you probably see it a lot right asked Brenda . 
_t4 		yes said Snuffy I would probably see it every day . 
_t4 		and if something is your favorite you probably like it a lot too right asked Brenda . 
_t4 		yes said Snuffy if it's my favorite I'd really love it . 
_t4 		so you should figure out your favorite color based on the things you see today explained Brenda . 
_t4 		and pay special attention to what you love the most . 
_t4 		what a super idea thanks Brenda exclaimed Snuffy as he flew up into the sky . 
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		neat . 
_t4 		how's that water ? 
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		oh what's that ? 
_t4 		the sun what's it doing ? 
_t4 		rising you're right . 
_t4 		that's exactly what it's doing . 
_t4 		Snuffy was ready to put his plan into action so he looked at the things around him . 
_t4 		mmmm the sun above me is yellow . 
_t4 		maybe yellow should be my favorite color he said . 
_t4 		but my sky writing smoke is white and so are the clouds so maybe white should be my favorite color . 
_t4 		hey Snuffy called Jay Jay how's it going ? 
_t4 		I'm still trying to choose my favorite color replied Snuffy . 
_t4 		wanna join me for some croc+water he asked Jay Jay . 
_t4 		that would be great answered Snuffy . 
_t4 		let's go fill up our water tanks suggested Jay Jay . 
_t4 		there you go guys said Brenda Blue your water tanks are filled to the brim . 
_t4 		thanks Brenda cheered Jay Jay I don't know what we'd do without you . 
_t4 		you're the best agreed Snuffy come on Snuffy we have work to do said Jay Jay . 
_t4 		and they taxied down the runway . 
_t4 		Jay Jay and Snuffy arrived at farmer Dale's field . 
_t4 		as they sprayed water on the crops Snuffy was thinking about what his favorite color might be . 
_t4 		mmmm parts of the field are brown so maybe brown should be my favorite color . 
_t4 		and the corn stalks are green so maybe green should be my favorite color . 
_t4 		but when the corn is picked it's yellow just like the sun that's two votes for yellow so maybe that should be my favorite color . 
_t4 		okay Snuffy said Jay Jay we have a lot of deliveries to make we'd better head back to Terrytown airport to refuel . 
_t4 		back at Terrytown airport Brenda Blue filled up their gas tanks . 
_t4 		you guys are refueled and ready to make your deliveries she said . 
_t4 		thanks Brenda called Jay Jay and Snuffy as they left the airport . 
_t4 		boy that Brenda Blue sure is a big help said Snuffy . 
_t4 		no kidding agreed Jay Jay she takes good care of us . 
_t4 		ooh look at that . 
_t4 		what's that ? 
_t4 		yeah do you know what the building is called ? 
_t4 		that's a barn . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		remember you have that book called big red barn ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		sure we'll look and see if we have it we'll read it okay ? 
_t4 		when you were a little tiny lil [: little] tiny teeny tiny girl you used to read that book all the time and you could read that book to me . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ? 
_t4 		well but you memorized the whole book (be)cause I used to read it to you all the time and you would every time I would turn the page you would read the book . 
_t4 		you would recite it . 
_t4 		I don't know if you remember it now we'll havta look for it . 
_t4 		while yes ? 
_t4 		oh . 
_t4 		oh okay . 
_t4 		maybe I'll read it once and then you can read it once . 
_t4 		(be)cause then you'll probably remember it . 
_t4 		oh alright . 
_t4 		while he was flying Snuffy thought to himself I love making deliveries so what colors do I see when I'm making them ? 
_t4 		that big barn near the river is red . 
_t4 		maybe red should be my favorite color . 
_t4 		and the flowers of Smiley Meadow are purple and orange . 
_t4 		maybe one of those should be my favorite color . 
_t4 		the deliveries took them over the docks of Terrytown and Snuffy looked again for his favorite color . 
_t4 		wow look at those boats one's pink one's black another is gold . 
_t4 		maybe one of those colors is my favorite . 
_t4 		what are you thinking about Snuffy asked Jay Jay ? 
_t4 		I'm still trying to figure out my favorite color . 
_t4 		well maybe you'll get lucky and it will come to like a flash of lightning said Jay Jay . 
_t4 		just then there was a flash of light and a rumbling sound in the sky . 
_t4 		whada [: what do] you think that sound is ? 
_t4 		thunder . 
_t4 		that doesn't sound good said Jay Jay . 
_t4 		the sky filled with clouds and the rain began to fall . 
_t4 		we better go home said Snuffy . 
_t4 		as Snuffy and Jay Jay flew back to Terrytown airport they got all wet but they knew when they arrived Brenda Blue would be waiting with a dry towel . 
_t4 		how are you feeling Snuffy asked Brenda as she finished drying him off ? 
_t4 		I feel great replied Snuffy thanks . 
_t4 		good I wouldn't want you to get rusty she said . 
_t4 		okay Jay Jay it's your turn . 
_t4 		Snuffy moved to the hanger door and noticed a rainbow he remembered he hadn't picked a favorite color . 
_t4 		Brenda said I should think of something I love and that might help me choose . 
_t4 		and Brenda's always right thought Snuffy . 
_t4 		in fact Brenda's one of the most helpful people I know . 
_t4 		she fills our water tanks when they're empty she refuels us when we're out of gas she dries us off when we get wet and much more . 
_t4 		I sure do love Brenda a lot . 
_t4 		hey that's it said Snuffy I just figured out my favorite color . 
