_t4 
_t4 		but I'm not positive (.) about that . 
_t4 		I think it's a Brazil nut .
_t4 
_t4 		let me see .
_t4 
_t4 		I think that's a hazelnut . 
_t4 		there are lots_of different kinds of nuts . 

_t4 
_t4 		well , I'm not sure .
_t4 
_t4 		I don't remember . 

_t4 		they have_to be broken to be eaten .
_t4 
_t4 		let's [: let us] see . 
_t4 		that one I'm not sure .
_t4 
_t4 		you're right , it is . 
_t4 		those are the same .
_t4 
_t4 		they match , don't they ?

_t4 		to make sure it stays closed . 
_t4 		okay , can you put that tape right there ? 
_t4 		right here . 
_t4 		right at the edge . 
_t4 		yep [: yes] and rub it . 
_t4 		so that closes the box . 
_t4 		now we need wrapping paper . 
_t4 		um: . 
_t4 		um: . 
_t4 		I think we use the gold wrapping paper . 
_t4 		since that seems to be +/.
_t4 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		le(t) me see: that's not big enough over there so: +...
_t4 
_t4 		yep [: yes] you're gonna help but le(t) me cut the right size of paper first . 
_t4 		oh the weather outside is frightful: . 
_t4 		there is but I'm singing it in the wrong +//.
_t4 
_t4 		with the wrong (.) notes . 
_t4 		because that's a song that I can never remember the right notes to . 
_t4 		okay this is our piece of paper for this box . 
_t4 		do you remember what the first thing we should do is ? 
_t4 		well the first thing we do +... 
_t4 		is we make sure the wrapping paper +//.
_t4 
_t4 		the nice side of the wrapping paper , the side we want to show , is actually on the floor . 
_t4 		this is the inside that no one's gonna see +//.
_t4 
_t4 		the white part . 
_t4 		and then we put our present (.) down on the wrapping paper . 
_t4 		and then we have_to do some folding +//.
_t4 
_t4 		do you remember what we do ? 
_t4 		how do we fold the paper +/?
_t4 
_t4 		(o)kay your end +//.
_t4 
_t4 		you take your end of the paper . 
_t4 		well we don't do the triangles just yet . 
_t4 		take both +//.
_t4 
_t4 		take this in one hand . 
_t4 		and this corner in that hand and bring the +//.
_t4 
_t4 		bring the paper right up here . 
_t4 		onto the box . 
_t4 		not triangles . 
_t4 		just bring all the paper . 
_t4 		right up onto the box . 
_t4 		and that's what I'm gonna do with my end also +//.
_t4 
_t4 		I'm holding this one down . 
_t4 		and now I'm bringing up this paper +//.
_t4 
_t4 		so we're gonna cover +... 
_t4 		here's some tape . 
_t4 		cover the box . 
_t4 		with the paper . 
_t4 		yep [: yes] go ahead and put the (.) tape right there that's good . 
_t4 		and I'll put a piece there and I think we need one more little piece . 
_t4 		right at the end . 
_t4 		good . 
_t4 		nope [: no] we actually don't need more there .
_t4 
_t4 		the secret to good wrapping is not to use too much tape I think . 
_t4 		now we're gonna make triangles +//.
_t4 
_t4 		this is a box so it's a little different . 
_t4 		our triangle's gonna look like that . 
_t4 		and like that . 
_t4 		now can you bring this up onto the main part of the box ? 
_t4 		pull up and then over . 
_t4 		it's different from wrapping something flat . 
_t4 		(o)kay I'm holding this , will you put some tape ? 
_t4 		to attach it +//.
_t4 
_t4 		we don't wanna cover all the edges with tape , we just wanna use +... 
_t4 		a small +... 
_t4 		amount . 
_t4 		teeny tiny pieces of tape . 
_t4 		would you put that one over there ? 
_t4 		goo:d okay . 
_t4 		and I'll put one here . 
_t4 		and now I'm gonna bring it aro:und . 

_t4 
_t4 		don't use it until I tell you okay ? 
_t4 		where's the triangles . 
_t4 		and then folding it up . 
_t4 		bringing it over . 
_t4 		there . 
_t4 		right on the edge and I'll put one little piece right here too . 
_t4 		and that's done . 
_t4 		well we have a lot more to wrap but we need to make sure we la:bel these and (.) and wrap them with ribbons and things so that +... 
_t4 		uh (.) so that (.) we know who they're for . 
