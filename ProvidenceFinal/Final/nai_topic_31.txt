_t4 		oh , you mean the bathroom ?
_t4 		those're [: those are] white curtains . 
_t4 		you want me to read this ?
_t4 		it belonged to two dolls named Lucinda and Jane . 
_t4 		at least it belonged to Lucinda , but she never ordered meals .
_t4 		Jane was the cook . 
_t4 		but she never did any cooking because the dinner had been bought ready made in a box full of shavings . 
_t4 		there were two red lobsters and a ham . 
_t4 		a fish , a pudding and some pears and oranges . 
_t4 		they would not come off the plates but they were extremely beautiful . 
_t4 		this is describing some toy food . 
_t4 		which is another name for (.) stroller .
_t4 		there was no one in the nursery and it was very quiet . 
_t4 		in a corner near the fireplace where there was a hole under the skirting+board . 
_t4 		Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment and then popped it in again . 
_t4 		Tom Thumb was a mouse . 
_t4 		this is a story about mice . 
_t4 		d'you [: do you] want me to keep reading ? 
_t4 		and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery she ventured out on the oil cloth under the coal box . 
_t4 		Tom Thumb and Hunka Munka went cautiously across the hearth rug . 
_t4 		they pushed the front door . 
_t4 		it was not fast .
_t4 		then they squeaked with joy . 
_t4 		squeak ! 
_t4 		such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table . 
_t4 		there were tin spoons and lead knives and forks and two dolly chairs , all so convenient . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		look they're eating .
_t4 		Tom Thumb set to work at once to carve the ham . 
_t4 		it was a beautiful shiny yellow streaked with red . 
_t4 		the knife crumpled up and hurt him . 
_t4 		he put his finger in his mouth .
_t4 		it is not boiled enough , it is hard . 
_t4 		you have a try Hunka Munka .
_t4 		Hunka Munka stood up on her chair and chopped at the ham with another lead knife . 
_t4 		said Hunka Munka +".
_t4 		Hunka Munka , isn't that a funny name ? 
_t4 		the ham broke off the plate with a jerk and rolled under the table . 
_t4 		let it alone . 
_t4 		said Tom Thumb .
_t4 		give me some fish Hunka Munka .
_t4 		Hunka Munka tried every tin spoon in turn , the fish was glued to the dish . 
_t4 		then Tom Thumb lost his temper , he put the ham in the middle of the floor and hit it with the tongs . 
_t4 		and with the shovel the shovel . 
_t4 		bang  smash smash .

_t4 		Big Bear looked and he saw that the dark part of the cave was very dark . 
_t4 		so he went to the lantern cupboard and took out the ti:niest lantern that was there . 
_t4 		Big Bear lit the tiniest lantern and put it next to Little Bear's bed .

_t4 		we need strings: +//.
_t4 		somewhere there's a sticker that should be a picture of strings: . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		oh there's lots_of blue words here .

_t4 		see there's a lower case r that starts the word . 
_t4 		put the ring right there . 
_t4 		ri:ng . 
_t4 		let's see , what else +//?
_t4 		oh .

_t4 		what letter do you think cakes begins with ?
_t4 		that's a very good guess . 
_t4 		but for ca:kes , it's actually c not k . 
_t4 		see that begins with letter c +//.
_t4 		that's the word cakes .

_t4 		d+w tied Pal's leash to a bench . 
_t4 		and went into the store . 
_t4 		a clown with balloons walked by . 
_t4 		Pal barked at him . 
_t4 		woof woof woof . 
_t4 		when d+w came out of the store , Pal was gone . 
_t4 		she looked up and down the street +... 
_t4 		that dog is trouble . 
_t4 		she cried . 
_t4 		and she ran to tell Arthur . 
_t4 		oh no , cried Arthur , why would Pal run away ? 
_t4 		maybe he's mad at you , said d+w . 
_t4 		you yelled at him today for chewing your slippers . 
_t4 		Arthur said nothing . 
_t4 		he just looked very sad . 
_t4 		but Kate had alot to say . 
_t4 		wa: wa: wa: wa: she cried . 
_t4 		then Arthur said , d+w take Kate home , maybe she needs a doctor . 
_t4 		and I need to find Pal , he began calling +...

_t4 		he:re Pal , he:re Pal . 
_t4 		Arthur passed the ring toss table , the bob for apples table , and a table with pumpkin pies , chocolate cakes , and cookies . 
_t4 		he wished there was a table with hamburgers . 
_t4 		Pal would be sure to be hanging around it . 
_t4 		have you seen a lost puppy , Arthur asked the police officer .

_t4 		yep [: yes] . 
_t4 		one was taken to the school . 
_t4 		oh thank you said Arthur and he ran to the school .

_t4 		back at the street fair the clown with the balloons tripped over his big floppy shoes: . 
_t4 		crash . 
_t4 		down he went . 
_t4 		and as he fell he let go of his balloons .

_t4 		one by one they burst . 
_t4 		Pal floated slowly down . 
_t4 		when he got home , he still had one beautiful red balloon .

_t4 		I also have bear food for bear emergencies .
_t4 		it might be a little bit spicy , why don't you try it .
_t4 		you've had it before . 
_t4 		it's the same kind you had the other day . 
_t4 		I think you liked it . 
_t4 		it's salty , but I think you liked it .

_t4 		um , it actually has salt in it . 
_t4 		that kind of salmon .
_t4 		smoked salmon .

_t4 		xxx .
_t4 		o:h . 
_t4 		right to the end , no ?
_t4 		okay .
_t4 		these are walnuts with the shells still on them .
_t4 		I'm gonna give you another muffin tin to put them into . 
_t4 		or you could actually put them into the ice+cube tray .

_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		mmmm , okay I think you're right .

_t4 		I think we have a muffin tin that has twelve . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		I'm gonna give you this big muffin tin . 
_t4 		because this has got twelve . 
_t4 		and the ice+cube tray also has tw(elve) +//. 
_t4 		does it ?
_t4 		three , four , five ,  oops .
_t4 		xxx , that has a different number actually . 
_t4 		that's all+right though .
_t4 		why don't you put them +...
_t4 		you can just put them wherever you want , okay ? 
_t4 		this isn't like the (.) sponges where you make them all go in the same +...
_t4 		these are different kinds of nuts . 
_t4 		you can practice putting them in there . 
_t4 		whoops . 
_t4 		whoops   okay . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		taking the nuts out ?
_t4 		there , you can take them out with your fingers . 
_t4 		that's another walnut . 
_t4 		that's an almond . 
_t4 		actually , you know , I'm not sure . 
_t4 		I think it's a Brazil nut .
_t4 		but I'm not positive (.) about that . 
_t4 		I think it's a Brazil nut .
_t4 		let me see .
_t4 		I think that's a hazelnut . 
_t4 		there are lots_of different kinds of nuts . 
_t4 		that's a hazelnut .
_t4 		just a sec(ond) .
_t4 		xxx I'll look in a second .
_t4 		just a second . 
_t4 		let's see .
_t4 		show it to me ?
_t4 		I think that's a hazelnut . 
_t4 		I think that's another hazelnut . 
_t4 		just a sec(ond) , honey .
_t4 		the ice+cube tray has more than twelve and the (.) muffin tin has twelve (.) places for twelve muffins . 
_t4 		xxx and I need some salt . 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 		just a second , honey . 
_t4 		let me see . 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 		well , I'm not sure .
_t4 		I don't remember . 
_t4 		that's something we're gonna have_to look up .
_t4 		usually when I buy nuts they already have the (.) shells taken off of them . 
_t4 		what you have there are the nuts with the shells still on .
_t4 		they have_to be broken to be eaten .
_t4 		let's [: let us] see . 
_t4 		that one I'm not sure .
_t4 		you're right , it is . 
_t4 		those are the same .
_t4 		they match , don't they ?
_t4 		you have matching +//. 
_t4 		do you wanna match (.) match the different nuts and the different kinds ?
_t4 		why don't you put all the nuts that match in one container and all the (.) nuts that look alike  with the dark brown in that container +... 
_t4 		no , I mean you put all the ones that like like this in here , put all the ones that look like that +//. 
_t4 		oh , you've kind of already sorted them for yourself .
_t4 		I see . 
_t4 		xxx , if you want to do that . 
_t4 		you don't have_to do that .
_t4 		I was just suggesting that you sort , practice sorting .
_t4 		they're too hard for your teeth to chew them .
_t4 		they're just too hard .
_t4 		it would break your teeth if you tried to +/.
_t4 		crack (th)em .
_t4 		but a bi:rd or , let's [: let us] see , some other kind of animal with strong teeth could probably do it . 
_t4 		they just don't .
_t4 		a bird with a really strong beak might be able to crack that .
_t4 		I don't really know for sure .
_t4 		cause [: because] I don't know everything , and I don't know everything about every kind of bird . 
_t4 		I only know some things about some kinds of birds . 
_t4 		oh dear , I think I've forgotten what a chickadee eats .
_t4 		xxx definitely eats some seeds .
