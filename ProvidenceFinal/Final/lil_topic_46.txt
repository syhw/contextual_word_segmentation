_t4 		in a balloon !
_t4 
_t4 		well you just feel like I guess the physics of it because like the heat rises and whatever that it's so simple that unless like you know some flying knife comes out and hits your balloon like that there's just not that much that can go assuming you're not (be)cause they do weather reporting so you're not gonna get hopefully caught in a thunderstorm or whatever . 

_t4 
_t4 		oh hot springs you can but those are all like a hundred and five to a hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit .
