_d3718 		oh you can't have lunch okay well then if you can't have lunch then you can't have pez . 
_d3718 		okay should we read about Snow White ? 
_d3718 		with hair as black as ebony and lips as red as roses and skin as white as snow this lovely princess is perfectly named Snow White . 
_d3718 		not only is she beautiful but she is sweet natured too . 
_d3718 		everyone loves her except of course her vain and jealous stepmother the queen . 
_d3718 		her favorite things include singing and dancing which always cheer her up and give her courage when she's afraid . 
_d3718 		telling stories is one of Snow White's great talents the seven dwarfs like to listen to her stories about the day her prince will come and how they'll live in a beautiful castle . 
_d3718 		the animals and birds of the forest love Snow White's kind and gentle nature . 
_d3718 		they even helped her clean up the dwarfs' messy cottage . 
_d3718 		Snow White loves to walk in the enchanted forest and pick pretty flowers . 
_d3718 		but she can't things into the too many flowers into the cottage because flowers make Sneezy sneeze . 
_d3718 		when dwarfs when the dwarfs find out that Snow White is a good cook they are delighted even more so when they discover she can bake their favorite gooseberry pie . 
_d3718 		yeah . 
_d3719 		beyond the farthest hill stands the castle where she grew up with her wicked stepmother . 
_d3719 		mmmm+hmmm ? 
_d3719 		right it's true . 
_d3719 		Snow White has nowhere to go and gets lost in the dense forest . 
_d3719 		eventually she can run no farther and she falls to the ground in tears  . 
_d3719 		the seven hills really are jeweled because there are dazzling diamonds inside . 
_d3719 		the seven dwarfs love to dig dig dig all day long in the diamond mines . 
_d3719 		xxx . 
_d3719 		oh+my+goodness . 
_d3719 		so this is where Snow White grew up . 
_d3719 		and this is where the dwarfs live . 
_d3719 		and that's the prince's castle . 
_d3719 		and (.) those are the diamond mines . 
_d3719 		and the waterfalls . 
_d3719 		mmmm+hmmm ? 
_d3719 		well this is when Snow White is  lost in the dark forest . 
_d3719 		right . 
_d3719 		right . 
_d3719 		right she got lost but the nice animals helped her out right ? 
_d3719 		and they took her to the seven dwarfs' cottage . 
_d3719 		right ? 
_d3719 		one of the great gifts that Snow White has is the ability to make friends easily . 
_d3719 		the animals and dwarfs would do anything for her even Grumpy . 
_d3719 		but the queen is madly jealous of her naturally beautiful stepdaughter and the cruel queen is a very dangerous enemy to have . 
_d3719 		as well as being Snow White's stepmother +... 
_d3719 		mmmm+hmmm ? 
_d3719 		right it says here as well as being Snow White's stepmother the queen is also a wicked witch . 
_d3719 		she does not like Snow White and she uses a poison apple to try and get rid of her . 
_d3719 		my+goodness . 
_d3719 		that's not nice at all . 
_d3719 		no no no . 
_d3719 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_d3719 
_d3719 		right it's true there is the poison apple . 
_d3719 		right . 
_d3719 		right . 
_d3719 		no no .
_d3719 
_d3719 		the seven dwarfs and the birds and animals that meet Snow White love her dearly . 
_d3719 		they try to protect her from the wicked queen and her spells . 
_d3719 		although the huntsman is a loyal servant of the queen +... 
_d3719 		he is always so sleepy isn't he .
_d3719 
_d3719 		there's Sneezy . 
_d3719 		choo .
_d3719 
_d3719 		that's right he's always sneezing . 
_d3719 		that's right . 
_d3719 		here's the huntsman he's a loyal servant of the queen but he is not wicked . 
_d3719 		seeing Snow White's sweet nature he cannot bear to carry out the queen's orders and hurt the princess . 
_d3719 		well but he decides he cannot hurt Snow White . 
_d3719 		he doesn't want to hurt her so he lets her go . 
_d3719 		right ? 
_d3719 		no it's not nice that he promised to do it in the first place right ? 
_d3719 		you're so soft . 
_d3719 		yes ? 
_d3719 		that's the queen's castle . 
_d3719 		where Snow White grew up . 
_d3719 		mmmm . 
_d3719 		not so good . 
_d3719 		nope nope nope nope . 
_d3719 		from the moment that Snow White becomes more beautiful than the queen her life is in danger . 
_d3719 		although the seven dwarfs tried their best they cannot protect her from the queen's black magic . 
_d3719 		but good is stronger than evil . 
_d3719 		and in the end the prince's love for Snow White saves the day . 
_d3719 		well at first he thinks he's going to hurt Snow White . 
_d3719 		but then he changes his mind he can't bring himself to harm her . 
_d3719 		and he tells Snow White to run away from the queen . 
_d3719 		yeah . 
_d3719 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_d3719 
_d3719 		right .
_d3719 
_d3719 		disguised as an old peddler woman the queen persuades trusting Snow White to take a bite of the poisoned apple . 
_d3719 		she promises it will make her dream come true . 
_d3719 		yes ? 
_d3719 		right .
_d3719 
_d3719 		as soon as Snow White takes a bite of the apple she falls to the ground in a deep sleep and cannot be woken . 
_d3719 		when the dwarves find her they place her in a special glass coffin . 
_d3719 		yes . 
_d3719 		she is very very mean you're right . 
_d3719 		mmmm+hmmm .
_d3719 
_d3719 		but the dwarfs and Snow White +... 
_d3719 		right . 
_d3719 		but Snow White and the dwarfs and the prince are all very nice aren't they ? 
_d3719 		yeah . 
_d3719 		you're so right . 
_d3719 		she is not nice at all . 
_d3719 		no no no no no . 

_d3719 		wow . 
_d3719 		let's see . 
_d3719 		Cinderella has no money to spend on clothes so her animal friends help her to patch up a simple dress an apron each morning and shine her worn out shoes . 
_d3719 		the birds and mice sew frills and bows on an old dress that once belonged to her mother so that Cinderella can go to the ball . 
_d3719 		uh+huh ? 
_d3719 		well we don't get to meet her mother . 

_d3719 		a little magic is all Cinderella needs to find happiness . 
_d3719 		she has charm and beauty and all the elegance of a princess . 
_d3719 		and with a little help from her fairy godmother her dreams come true . 
_d3719 		to celebrate the prince's return all eligible ladies in the land are invited to attend a ball at the castle . 
_d3719 		well they are so jealous of Cinderella that they tear her outfit to pieces . 

_d3720 		as soon as their eyes meet at the ball Cinderella and the prince fall in love . 

_d3720 		soon her dress +... 
_d3720 		right . 
_d3720 		but she leaves it there . 
_d3720 		and the grand duke is absolutely delighted when Cinderella produces the matching glass slipper and puts it on her dainty foot . 
_d3720 		right . 

_d3730 		everyone laughed except for Lisa and me but it gave me an idea . 
_d3730 		Lisa let's play a joke on our classmates I said and I told her my plan . 
_d3730 		first we made two little signs and then we crept under the bars . 
_d3730 		we put the signs in front of us and froze like statues . 
_d3730 		I had forgotten to take off my scarf but our classmates didn't notice . 
_d3730 		some of them even took pictures of us . 
_d3730 		lots_of pictures . 
_d3730 		our plan worked perfectly . 
_d3730 		so perfectly that our class left without us . 
_d3730 		the lights went out and the door closed  no . 
_d3730 		we were locked in the museum . 
_d3730 		what's to become of us Lisa cried ? 
_d3730 		don't be afraid I answered we'll find something to eat we'll go to sleep and tomorrow we'll leave . 
_d3730 		but the only thing to eat were dinosaur bones and in the dark they were sort of scary . 
_d3730 		it was terrible being locked in the dark suddenly the dinosaurs started growling . 
_d3730 		ah we shouted help . 
_d3730 		but it wasn't the dinosaur it was the guard's dog who came to rescue us . 
_d3730 		our teacher and classmates were happy to see us and boy were we happy to see them . 
_d3730 		yeah . 
