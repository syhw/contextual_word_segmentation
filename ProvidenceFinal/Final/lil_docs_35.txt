_d3670 		well then we'd have_to cut it out or something . 
_d3670 		I know that would that's true but I still don't know if we'd be able to get it out . 
_d3670 		Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes . 
_d3670 		oh great . 
_d3670 		you know what ? 
_d3670 		I love you . 
_d3670 		Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes . 
_d3670 		he could name the months of the year and all the seasons . 
_d3670 		he could read the thermometer and he checked the barometer every day . 
_d3670 		Franklin worried about the weather because he was afraid of storms . 
_d3670 		one day Franklin was supposed to play at fox's house but the sky was getting dark and the clouds were thick . 
_d3670 		maybe I shouldn't go Franklin said to his mother . 
_d3670 		she looked out the window it probably won't rain until later she said you've got time to get to fox's . 
_d3670 		Franklin put on his boots and took the umbrella . 
_d3670 		as Franklin hurried to fox's house he kept looking at the sky the clouds moved quickly and the winds swirled dirt in the air . 
_d3670 		Franklin felt all jumpy inside . 
_d3670 		fox was playing outside when Franklin arrived Franklin pointed nervously to the sky I think we should go inside don't you he asked ? 
_d3670 		not yet fox grinned I love watching the clouds move and feel the wind blow it's exciting . 
_d3670 		I think it's scary said Franklin . 
_d3670 		is Franklin a lil [: little] scared ? 
_d3670 		yeah .
_d3670 
_d3670 		beaver snail and hawk came over to play too . 
_d3670 		my fur feels funny when it's about to storm said fox . 
_d3670 		my feathers get all ruffled said hawk beaver sniffed I can smell a storm coming . 
_d3670 		hmmm who do you think lives in here ? 
_d3670 		oh snail lives in that little (.) tree stump huh ? 
_d3670 		I think he does .
_d3670 
_d3670 		that's a cute little house for snail donchou [: don't you] think ? 
_d3670 		mmmm+huh . 
_d3670 		Franklin held on to his hat and shivered it was almost as dark as night when big fat raindrops began to fall . 
_d3670 		we should go in shouted Franklin . 
_d3670 		no said fox follow me and they raced to the tree+house where it was dry . 
_d3670 		do you think that's a good idea to go to the tree+house when it's a thunder storm ? 
_d3670 		no . 
_d3670 		you could get hurt in a tree+house that's true . 
_d3670 		fox called his mother it's time to come in it's alright said fox we're in the tree . 
_d3670 		fox's mother was there in a second it's dangerous to be near a tree during a storm she said . 
_d3670 		lighting strikes tall things first and you might get hurt . 
_d3670 		right . 
_d3670 		you sure were right . 
_d3670 		Franklin held on to fox's mother all the way from the tree to the house they were barely in the door when there was a flash of zig zag light . 
_d3670 		lightening shrieked Franklin he trembled . 
_d3670 		thunder he screamed . 
_d3670 		that's okay Franklin said his friends we're safe here . 
_d3670 		but Franklin has crawled deep inside his shell fox's mother brought treats but still Franklin wouldn't come out . 
_d3670 		Franklin's friends begged him to play but Franklin stayed put . 
_d3670 		then with a flash and a crash the lights went out . 
_d3670 		don't worry said fox's mother she lit candles and turned on a flashlight . 
_d3670 		won't you come out now she asked Franklin ? 
_d3670 		no thank you said Franklin . 
_d3670 		don't be afraid said hawk all that noise is just cloud giants playing drums in the sky . 
_d3670 		Franklin peeked out really he asked ? 
_d3670 		no it's not giggled snail that noise is when the giants go bowling . 
_d3670 		Franklin came out of his shell what about lightening he asked ? 
_d3670 		oh that's easy said hawk the cloud giants are turning their lights on and off . 
_d3670 		fox smiled I think it's the giants swinging from their chandeliers . 
_d3670 		Franklin laughed . 
_d3670 		giants that's ridiculous said beaver mr owl said that lightening is a big spark of electricity that travels from the sky to the ground . 
_d3670 		the spark is so hot it makes the air around it pop and that's the sound of thunder . 
_d3670 		amazing said Franklin . 
_d3670 		Franklin felt a little better he even played flashlight tag with his friends . 
_d3670 		soon there was hardly any lightening the thunder was a low rumble from far away and the rain stopped . 
_d3670 		then the lights when on the storms over said fox let's go outside and play . 
_d3670 		look said Franklin a rainbow . 
_d3670 		I know why the storm is over Franklin said those giants heard there's a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow and they've gone to find it . 
_d3670 		even beaver had to smile . 
