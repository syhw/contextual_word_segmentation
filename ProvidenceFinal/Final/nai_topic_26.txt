_t4 		I don't think the deer actually come into the strawberry patch to poop . 
_t4 		do you have a twenty+four hour video camera ,  ? 
_t4 		I think it was one of these things where they were right on top , they were , you know .
_t4 		here .
_t4 		well , it's hard to , to do it by hand .
_t4 		why don't I use the knife ?
_t4 		to make it easier to eat , okay ? 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 		oh , you got strawberry in your eye ?

_t4 		I think Fancy had longer Saturday hours . 
_t4 		you're right .
_t4 		but this place is unknown . 
_t4 		oh I hate  .
_t4 		the other thing is we could go out but that involves everybody , getting ready to go out which takes too long .
_t4 		it's a huge production .
_t4 		I could make something but +...

_t4 		you don't wanna do yogurt ?
_t4 		you didn't have any yogurt . 
_t4 		remember this , this bowl has letters on it .

_t4 		spells baby Bjorn . 
_t4 		I would actually like to get , more of these bowls . 
_t4 		and the spoons that go with em [: them] are just right too . 
_t4 		I think they're too deep they're , too much like her bowl . 
_t4 		the spoons .

_t4 		they're not deep . 
_t4 		they're the same , about the same as this +... 
_t4 		there was a bird at the feeder ? 
_t4 		what was he doing ? 
_t4 		he was eating some seeds ?
_t4 		how did he know that the seeds were there ? 
_t4 		that's a good question . 
_t4 		how did he know , that the seeds were there ? 
_t4 		because we put them there , maybe he saw us putting them there ? 
_t4 		that would be one way he would know . 
_t4 		not the weeds . 
_t4 		we planted the seeds not the weeds .
_t4 		we want the seeds to grow not the weeds . 
_t4 		flowers ? 
_t4 		the weeds were flowering ? 
_t4 		you were helping me so much when we were pulling weeds down at the garden the other day .
_t4 		you were tugging them up , yeah .
_t4 		you were tugging weeds ? 
_t4 		we have lots more things to plant in our garden . 
_t4 		beans , and I ordered some more seeds from a , kind of a rare seed place . 
_t4 		a french pumpkin . 
_t4 		a french pumpkin ? 
_t4 		why ?

_t4 		oh yes , bachelor's+buttons ! 
_t4 		good idea .
_t4 		you have_to find a special place for them with Daddy . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		you gonna make a row for them , just like we made rows in the garden . 
_t4 		you could do that . 
_t4 		I would spare space if you wanted to , have them in the , vegetable garden . 
_t4 		boy the birds are really , feeding . 
_t4 		and they're chirping .
_t4 		are they hungry ?
_t4 		I think bachelor's+buttons need sun , right ?
_t4 		or at least partial sun . 
_t4 		you know what might be a good place ? 
_t4 		this , area , right here , actually gets morning sun .
_t4 		yeah , I know .
_t4 		I don't think it does all day .
_t4 		I know .
_t4 		but , you could just clear out , some of whatever's there and put them . 
_t4 		this variety is tall bachelor's+buttons .
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		see how tall they are . 
_t4 		maybe Tuesday when it's , if maybe if it's not raining . 
_t4 		drought tolerant .
_t4 		in the vegetable garden ? 
_t4 		we could plant them there , too .
_t4 		early spring , one to two weeks before last frost so really they should , be +...
_t4 		yeah , it's it's a perfect time . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		seeds require dark to germinate .
_t4 		completely cover . 
_t4 		mmmm .
_t4 		some , some don't . 
_t4 		okay , does not transplant well . 
_t4 		two to three foot tall , that's really tall for bachelor's+buttons . 
_t4 		huh , it'd be interesting . 
_t4 		no , three feet is common . 
_t4 		two to three .
_t4 		well you see , you see them , from time to time . 
_t4 		I've never seen bachelor's+buttons that tall .
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		I have up to here . 
_t4 		well , then , it's a variety for you . 
_t4 		that'll be nice , I think that would be a good place .

_t4 		would you like some toast to eat Naima ? 
_t4 		I'll toast the toast , for you .

_t4 		yeah we have very little , in fact , I , keep meaning to tell you . 
_t4 		I haven't been using it so I haven't noticed .
_t4 		I'm looking for bread so that I can make the toast for you .

_t4 		there's a different kind of fan called , a fan , somebody who likes something a lot is called a fan . 
_t4 		that's short for fanatic . 
_t4 		oh , what's the fan gonna blow out ?
_t4 		fans blow air . 
_t4 		but when people are fans we mean that they're fanatics .
_t4 		that means they really like something a lot .
_t4 		that means they really really really like something they're called fans . 
_t4 		what was used to go in the house , fans ? 
_t4 		the big fan ? 
_t4 		upstairs in the ceiling ?
_t4 		oh in the old house , you mean .
_t4 		in the old house , the big noisy fan ?
