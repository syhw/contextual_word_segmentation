_t4 		you come sit on Mommy's lap . 
_t4 		mmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		Paddington's lucky day . 
_t4 		you know Paddington lives in England . 
_t4 		we went to England when we went to Ireland , the airplane stopped there .
_t4 
_t4 		it's a big outdoor market quite near here .
_t4 
_t4 		you should bring your pocket money added Jonathan . 
_t4 		there's a lot to see . 
_t4 		Paddington didn't need asking twice , and soon afterward they all set off . 
_t4 		suddenly they turned a corner and found themself in what seemed like a different world . 
_t4 		a world of outdoor stands and push+carts , gold and silver ornaments , books , old furniture , fruit and vegetables , people . 
_t4 		his eyes grew larger and larger as he tried to take it all in . 
_t4 		sweetie pie , you know what ? 
_t4 		you know where we keep your books in your room ? 
_t4 		in your bedroom ?
_t4 
_t4 		exactly , the thing that your diapers are in .
_t4 
_t4 		there's a picture on there , and Daddy and I bought that picture on Portabello road . 
_t4 		before you were born .
_t4 
_t4 		and a picture of a Mommy and her little baby girl .
_t4 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		one store was even having its picture taken . 
_t4 		that's a new supermarket explained Judy .
_t4 
_t4 		there must be something special going on there .
_t4 
_t4 		do we like the supermarket ? 
_t4 		what do you get at the supermarket ?
_t4 
_t4 		that's right .
_t4 
_t4 		Paddington's mouth began to water as he peered through the  , through the glass . 
_t4 		perhaps I could do some shopping for you Missus Brown he said hopefully .
_t4 
_t4 		Missus Brown hesitated . 
_t4 		she wasn't at all sure about letting him go off on his own quite so soon . 
_t4 		but Jonathan told her not to worry . 
_t4 		even Paddington can't get lost in a supermarket he said .
_t4 
_t4 		what goes in must come out . 
_t4 		we can meet him back by the check+out counter on our way back added Judy . 
_t4 		Paddington felt most important as he entered the store .
_t4 
_t4 		he lifted his hat to the manager who was standing just inside the door .
_t4 
_t4 		that's the manager . 
_t4 		what's he wearing ?
_t4 
_t4 		a suit , right .
_t4 
_t4 		and that man's wearing a coat .
_t4 
_t4 		what's he wearing around his neck ? 
_t4 		a tie , you're right .
_t4 
_t4 		and what's that man wearing on his face ? 
_t4 		what's he wearing on his +//. 
_t4 		over his eyes .
_t4 
_t4 		is he wearing  +/.
_t4 
_t4 		that's right , he's wearing glasses .
_t4 
_t4 		everywhere he looked there were shelves piled high with boxes and cans . 
_t4 		there was even one shelf with nothing but marmalade . 
_t4 		marmalade's [: marmalade is] like jam . 
_t4 		do you like jam ? 
_t4 		there it is , you're right . 
_t4 		he could certainly see why it was called a super market . 
_t4 		his paws were soon full , and he was just beginning to wish he's left his suitcase at home when he saw the manager coming towards him pushing a large basket on wheels . 
_t4 		may I suggest you use one of these sir , he called . 
_t4 		you can take as much as you want now , he continued . 
_t4 		can I really , exclaimed Paddington . 
_t4 		the manager nodded . 
_t4 		yes , we like to make our customers happy . 
_t4 		Paddington looked most impressed . 
_t4 		in that case he said , I think I'll have two baskets just to make sure . 
_t4 		the more Paddington saw of the super+market the more he liked it . 
_t4 		and he was sure Missus Brown would be pleased when she saw all her free groceries . 
_t4 		uh+oh . 
_t4 		Paddington thinks he can take them for free . 
_t4 		the other customers looked on in amazement . 
_t4 		perhaps he's trying to win an eating prize suggested one lady as he went by . 
_t4 		but the customers weren't the only ones who were watching Paddington with interest . 
_t4 		since he had been in the sore , the manager had been joined by several other important looking men . 
_t4 		and as Paddington reached the check out counter , one of them gave a signal and they all started to clap . 
_t4 		Paddington had never been in a store where they tried so hard to make their customers happy , and he gave the man a friendly wave .
_t4 
_t4 		a+choo , did someone sneeze ? 
_t4 		is your nose stuffy ?
_t4 
_t4 		do you want Mommy to clean it ?
_t4 
_t4 		your sneeze fell ? 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 
_t4 		well done said the lady handing him a ticket . 
_t4 		I hope you've brought a truck with you .
_t4 
_t4 		there's over a hundred and fifty dollars worth here . 
_t4 		Paddington stared at the long roll of paper in his paw . 
_t4 		over a hundred and fifty dollars worth , he gasped . 
_t4 		but I've only got a nickel . 
_t4 		looking up , Paddington suddenly caught sight of a crowd of people coming toward him . 
_t4 		watch out , cried the lady as he made a grab for the groceries . 
_t4 		but it was too late .
_t4 
_t4 		with a roar like an express train , everything began to tumble down off the counter . 
_t4 		oh no it's falling on Paddington . 
_t4 		Paddington was still sitting on the floor covered in groceries .
_t4 
_t4 		where's Paddington ? 
_t4 		there he is .
_t4 
_t4 		he was still sitting on the floor covered with groceries when the Browns rushed into the store to see what was going on . 
_t4 		all in all , he decided he was much safer where he was for the time being . 
_t4 		what's that ? 
_t4 		a turkey .
_t4 
_t4 		that's right . 
_t4 		you wouldn't think , said the manager , that giving someone a prize would be so difficult .
_t4 
_t4 		a prize , echoed the Browns . 
_t4 		and the manager pointed to a large notice on the wall . 
_t4 		this young bear happens to be our thousandth customer today .
_t4 
_t4 		that's a big sign .
_t4 
_t4 		perhaps you'd like to tell him he's won a free supply of groceries . 
_t4 		xxx , all of which , said Judy as they staggered home laden with groceries , only goes to show that bears always fall on their feet . 
_t4 		even in super+markets . 
_t4 		Paddington sniffed the air happily . 
_t4 		I like Portabello road , he said .
_t4 
_t4 		I think I shall always do my shopping here from now on .
_t4 
_t4 		yay .
_t4 
_t4 		what book do you wanna read now ?
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		which book is that ? 
_t4 		Paddington at the seaside .
_t4 
_t4 		great .
_t4 
_t4 		he's got some floats on his arms . 
_t4 		today , said Mister Brown at breakfast one bright summer morning , feels like the kind of day for taking a young bear to the seaside . 
_t4 		hands up all those who agree . 
_t4 		Jonathan , Judy , and Missus Brown all put up their hands . 
_t4 		and Paddington raised both his paws as well , just to make sure .
_t4 
_t4 		there's a tent at the seaside , there is , we're gonna get to that , you're right . 
_t4 		everyone was very excited , and by the time they set out , the Brown's car was so full of things there was scarcely room to move . 
_t4 		Paddington carefully fastened his seat+belt . 
_t4 		do you think he sits in a special car+seat like yours ? 
_t4 		yes , I think so too .
_t4 
_t4 		are we nearly there Mister Brown he asked hopefully ?
_t4 
_t4 		he's looking out the window , you're right . 
_t4 		Mister Brown removed a shovel handle from his left ear . 
_t4 		I'm afraid not , he said gloomily , we've only just left Windsor gardens and it's a very long way to the sea . 
_t4 		Mister Brown was right , it was a long journey . 
_t4 		but when they reached the seaside , the sight of the land and water soon made up for it . 
_t4 		Paddington gave an excited sniff as he climbed out of the car . 
_t4 		even the air had a different smell . 
_t4 		that's because it's special seaside air , said Missus Brown , it's very good for you .
_t4 
_t4 		what are those ? 
_t4 		what are those ? 
_t4 		remember what type of special bird they are , near the ocean ? 
_t4 		are they seagulls ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		you saw a sign with seagulls on Waterman street .
_t4 
_t4 		when we were driving back .
_t4 
_t4 		she  , I just taught her seagulls this morning , and we were driving back from my sister's ,  , when she was at work .
_t4 
_t4 		Lily said seagulls seagulls , and there's like a +...
_t4 
_t4 		I don't know , some sort of +... 
_t4 		like a dental office or something like that that's got seagulls on it .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		are you so smart ?
_t4 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		Paddington looked around anxiously as Mister Brown began laying out beach things . 
_t4 		I hope the air doesn't get used up , Missus Brown , he said in a loud voice .
_t4 
_t4 		and he gave a man doing deep breathing exercises a very hard stare indeed . 
_t4 		come on Paddington , called Judy , let's go for a swim . 
_t4 		it took Paddington quite a while to get ready . 
_t4 		he wasn't the sort of bear who believed in taking chances , and by the time he went into the sea , he was wearing so many things he promptly sank .
_t4 
_t4 		no wonder , cried Judy , you haven't even bothered to blow up your paw+bands . 
_t4 		fancy wearing a duffel coat in the water , exclaimed Jonathan . 
_t4 		I thought the water might be cold , said Paddington . 
_t4 		after his paw+bands had been properly blown up , Paddington went in the water again . 
_t4 		and with some help from Jonathan and Judy he was soon swimming very well indeed . 
_t4 		oh , she's got a lollipop .
_t4 
_t4 		Paddington had barely closed his eyes when he had heard something very strange going on behind him . 
_t4 		first there was a loud cry . 
_t4 		then there were the sound of people booing . 
_t4 		Paddington jumped up +/.
_t4 
_t4 		lollipop .
_t4 
_t4 		jumped up and looked at the others as if he could hardly believe his ears . 
_t4 		but Mister and Missus Brown seemed much too busy with the picnic things to be bothered .
_t4 
_t4 		oh who's got the ice cream cone ?
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		where's Paddington asked Jonathan when he and Judy arrived back shortly afterwards carrying ice cream cones and an ice stick . 
_t4 		I hope he's not long said Judy , I brought him a special cone . 
_t4 		he'll be most upset if it melts . 
_t4 		the Browns gave a gasp as they turned to follow the direction of Jonathan's gaze . 
_t4 		something very odd seemed to be going on inside the Punch and Judy tent . 
_t4 		there was a large bulge on one side , and it was heaving up and down almost as if it were alive . 
_t4 		suddenly the tent began moving across the sand , scattering people in all directions . 
_t4 		it just missed a large sand castle , went twice around the ice cream man and headed toward sea . 
_t4 		quick shouted Judy , let's cut it off . 
_t4 		but it was too late . 
_t4 		Paddington , cried Judy as a familiar face swam into view . 
_t4 		what on earth are you doing ? 
_t4 		that's the second time I've had to rescue you .
_t4 
_t4 		Paddington stared at her in amazement . 
_t4 		but I went to rescue you , he said .
_t4 
_t4 		seagulls .
_t4 
_t4 		Missus Brown said you were being punched by Mister Briggs . 
_t4 		Missus Brown +/.
_t4 
_t4 		seagulls .
_t4 
_t4 		Missus Brown looked at Paddington in astonishment .
_t4 
_t4 		and then her face cleared .
_t4 
_t4 		I didn't say Mister Briggs was punching Judy , I said it was his Punch and Judy . 
_t4 		it's a puppet theater said Judy . 
_t4 		they often have them at the seaside . 
_t4 		there's one puppet called Mister Punch , and when he gets cross all the audience has to boo . 
_t4 		a lollipop .
_t4 
_t4 		if it took the Browns a long time to explain a Punch and Judy show to Paddington , it took them even longer to explain Paddington to Mister Briggs . 
_t4 		but when he saw the enormous crowd watching his face lit up . 
_t4 		it was the biggest audience he'd had in a long time , and decided to make the most of it by putting on another show . 
_t4 		you can have a seat in the front row , he said to Paddington . 
_t4 		I expect bears do very good boos . 
_t4 		one way and another Paddington enjoyed his day out at the seaside . 
_t4 		but all good things come to an end , and when it was time to leave he stood for a moment holding up an empty marmalade jar . 
_t4 		I'm just collecting some sea air for the journey home , he said . 
_t4 		yay .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx . 

_t4 
_t4 		which should we read first , Sam or cookies ?
_t4 
_t4 		Sam ?
_t4 
_t4 		don't you feel well Sam ? 
_t4 		it was a cold cold night on plum street . 
_t4 		in the little white house , Missus Bear was putting Sam to bed . 
_t4 		she closed their favorite book and they both blew out the candle . 
_t4 		xxx , kiss goodnight Sam , Missus Bear said , and she wrapped him all cozy in the blanket that was red . 
_t4 		but suddenly , she heard a cough . 
_t4 		what does a cough sound like ? 
_t4 		and there sat Sam , curled up and small , and coughing in his bed .
_t4 
_t4 		Missus Bear put her arms around Sam . 
_t4 		don't you feel well Sam ?
_t4 
_t4 		Sam shook his head ,   . 
_t4 		poor Saam . 
_t4 		Missus Brown hugged him harder and kissed his warm cheek .
_t4 
_t4 		you have a cough , she said , and she dashed down the stairs , and up again with +...
_t4 
_t4 		the cough syrup .
_t4 
_t4 		open wide Sam , she said . 
_t4 		Sam shook his head .
_t4 
_t4 		tastes bad , he said .
_t4 
_t4 		yes , said his Mama , you need to be brave . 
_t4 		Sam put the blanket on his head . 
_t4 		I don't have a cough ,   . 
_t4 		try again Sam , said his Mama . 
_t4 		Sam shook the blanket off his head .
_t4 
_t4 		he opened up , then closed his mouth tight . 
_t4 		the spoon was too big .
_t4 
_t4 		too big , said Sam ,   . 
_t4 		you can do it , Missus Bear said . 
_t4 		I know you can .
_t4 
_t4 		Sam opened up , then closed his mouth tight .
_t4 
_t4 		too much syrup on a too big spoon . 
_t4 		too much , said Sam ,   . 
_t4 		Missus Bear rubbed frost off the window and peeked outside . 
_t4 		soon it will snow , she said , open wide Sam , and afterward we'll go downstairs and wait for snow .
_t4 
_t4 		snow ! 
_t4 		Sam opened wide , then very wide . 
_t4 		he sputtered and snorted and made a big face , but the syrup went down .
_t4 
_t4 		brave Sam , he said .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		brave Sam .
_t4 
_t4 		Missus Bear and Sam held hands on the stairs . 
_t4 		Sam wore his robe that was blue and his slippers were too . 
_t4 		they lit a little fire in the kitchen and made a pot of +...
_t4 
_t4 		tea .
_t4 
_t4 		and Missus Bear put extra +... 
_t4 		honey in the tea and it was nice sliding down .
_t4 
_t4 		after tea , they sat in the big purple chair by the window and waited for snow . 
_t4 		Missus Bear told a story about a bear called Sam . 
_t4 		Sam liked the story so much she told it again . 
_t4 		xxx  went the cough , every now and then . 
_t4 		Sam leaned back on his Mama's soft belly which wriggled when she talked . 
_t4 		the little fire glowed , and the kitchen was warm .

_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		and all through the night Missus Bear and Sam sat in the big purple chair and waited . 
