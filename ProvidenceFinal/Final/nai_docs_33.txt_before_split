_d5733 		xxx doesn't matter . 
_d5733 		you can have it wherever you want it . 

_d5733 		it's hiding pretty well if you can't see him (.) or her . 

_d5734 		you know , a fox who finds a chicken coop +//. 
_d5734 		the fox can probably smell the chickens through the walls of the chicken coop .

_d5734 		and I bet that fox would prowl around and go around the chicken coop walking around looking for ways to get in . 
_d5734 		don't you think it can just jump in over those walls ? 
_d5734 		maybe the chicken coop should have (.) a roof . 
_d5734 		xxx ,  dear (.) ,  dear , our chicken coop isn't (.) doesn't have a roof ! 
_d5734 		chickens , chickens , o:h . 
_d5734 		sometimes what a fox will do is carry an egg or maybe even a chick or a chicken off .
_d5734 
_d5734 		it won't actually stay to eat it there , I don't think .
_d5734 
_d5734 		because it wants to run away and make sure the people don't catch it , so it will carry away a chick or an egg . 
_d5734 		yeah , let's [: let us] have a den for the fox .
_d5734 
_d5735 		hmmm , I was thinking (.) we could make +//. 

_d5736 
_d5736 		there's the forest (.) with the trees . 

_d5741 
_d5741 		there's water from (.) all the way from the bottom .

_d5741 		sometimes it's fun to make things harder .
_d5741

_d5741 		did you know this is called an edge ?
_d5741 
_d5741 		this is the +/.
_d5741 
_d5741 		this is the right edge of the puzzle , and this is the left edge of the puzzle .
_d5741 
_d5742 		and this is the top edge of the puzzle , and this is the bottom edge of the puzzle . 
_d5742 		well , where do you think sky might go ? 
_d5742 		which edge do you think the sky might go (.) at ? 
_d5742 		the top edge , right ?
_d5742 
_d5742 		this is the top edge . 
_d5742 		I would guess sky would go at the top edge of the puzzle . 
_d5742 		no it , no it might go somewhere here .
_d5742 
_d5742 		you might need to have something else he:re .
_d5742 
_d5742 		should we find all the sky pieces ? 
_d5742 		and then try to f(ind) +/.
_d5742 
_d5742 		yup [: yes] .
_d5742 
_d5742 		well (.) the  +//.
_d5742 
_d5742 		which is the straight part of that piece ?
_d5742 
_d5742 		this part is straight . 
_d5742 		so put the straight part against the straight part of the puzzle base . 
_d5742 		right ?
_d5742 
_d5742 		okay , let's [: let us] see where that one goes . 
_d5742 		does it go there ? 
_d5742 		he:y , it does ! 
_d5742 		here's some more sky .
_d5742 
_d5742 		yeah .
_d5742 
_d5742 		I think those are all sky pieces .
_d5742 
_d5742 		is that a cor(ner) +//?
_d5742 
_d5742 		o:h , you're right .
_d5742 
_d5743 		that looks like a sky: corner piece . 
_d5743 		I don't know . 
_d5743 		try that maybe ?
_d5743 
_d5743 		yeah ?
_d5743 
_d5743 		xxx . 
_d5743 		somewhere up here , I think along the top edge . 
_d5743 		does it fit ? 
_d5743 		does it +...
_d5743 
_d5743 		does it have a little brown piece ?
_d5743 
_d5743 		how many pieces are along the top edge ?
_d5743 
_d5743 		eight !
_d5743 
_d5743 		eight .
_d5743 
_d5743 		this is number eight .
_d5743 
_d5743 		yeah .
_d5743 
_d5743 		one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . 
_d5743 		that means there will be eight pieces along the bottom edge also . 
_d5743 		cause [: because] they will have the same number of pieces . 
_d5743 		this also looks like sky . 
_d5743 		he:y !
_d5743 
_d5743 		is it +//? 
_d5743 		does it have a straight edge , that piece ?
_d5743 
_d5743 		hmmm . 
_d5743 		I see some more +...
_d5743 
_d5743 		let's [: let us] see , those two pieces have some sky . 
_d5743 		this piece has some sky .
_d5743 
_d5743 		let's [: let us] get all the pieces with some sky .
_d5743 
_d5743 		this has a +//.
_d5743 
_d5743 		did you say (v)oila ?
_d5743 
_d5743 		voila ,  .
_d5743 
_d5743 		did Daddy teach you that word ? 
_d5743 		voila: .
_d5743 
_d5743 		xxx .
_d5743 
_d5743 		is that something you say when you do puzzles ? 
_d5743 		xxx .
_d5743 
_d5743 		it almost goes , but it needs to have a straight (.) edge . 
_d5743 		this is the left edge of the puzzle .
_d5743 
_d5743 		so you need to have a piece that has +/.
_d5743 
_d5743 		a straight edge .
_d5743 
_d5743 		what about that one ?
_d5743 
_d5743 		wanna try that one ?
_d5743 
_d5743 		wanna try that one ? 
_d5743 		mmmm . 
_d5743 		well that wouldn't need to have a straight +//. 
_d5743 		whatever goes here would need to have a straight edge .
_d5743 
_d5743 		and there's no more sky . 
_d5743 		we should get some more edge pieces . 
_d5743 		hmmm , there's a lot of edge piece(s) +/.
_d5743 
_d5743 		it's an edge +//.
_d5743 
_d5743 		it needs to be an edge piece that has some of this color water .
_d5743 
_d5743 		with a straight edge +/.
_d5743 
_d5744 		mmmm , that's a good guess . 
_d5744 		let's [: let us] see , straight edges but with water . 
_d5744 		this piece has a straight edge and some water . 
_d5744 		wanna check that one out ? 
_d5744 		voila: !
_d5744 
_d5744 		and the next piece below that would be one that has a straight edge and some fe:rns .
_d5744 
_d5744 		one straight edge +//. 
_d5744 		this has one straight edge and some ferns .
_d5744 
_d5744 		do you wanna check and see if that goes there ? 
_d5744 		xxx . 
_d5744 		and then the next piece would have one straight edge and some tree trunk . 
_d5744 		and maybe part of the neck , tree trunk and neck . 
_d5744 		are there any pieces with straight edges that have some tree trunk and some neck ? 
_d5744 		I'm finding all the pieces with straight edges . 
_d5744 		this is +... 
_d5744 		this has got tree trunk .
_d5744 
_d5744 		straight edge and it has tree trunk . 
_d5744 		does that go I wonder ? 
_d5744 		match up the straight edge of the piece with the straight edge of the puzzle . 
_d5744 		that means turn it around so that the straight edge is there . 
_d5744 		he:y .
_d5744 
_d5744 		oh you're right . 
_d5744 		that piece needs to be a corner .
_d5744 
_d5744 		mmmm there must be corner pieces somewhere . 
_d5744 		can you look carefully ?
_d5744 
_d5744 		a corner piece is a piece that has two straight edges , right ?
_d5744 
_d5744 		that has two straight edges , there and there .
_d5744 
_d5744 		mmmm+hmmm , here , you're sitting on some .
_d5744 
_d5744 		yeah .
_d5744 
_d5744 		okay .
_d5744 
_d5744 		so we need a corner piece that has some tree+trunk . 
_d5744 		I'm looking for another corner piece . 
_d5744 		oh , here's a corner piece . 
_d5744 		wanna try that one ?
_d5744 
_d5744 		no:w , I have a question for you . 
_d5744 		how many corner pieces does this puzzle have ?
_d5744 
_d5744 		when it's all done , how many corner pieces would there be ? 
_d5744 		right , when it's all done there should be four corner pieces cause [: because] there are four corners in this rectangular puzzle . 
_d5744 		and how many do we have so far ?
_d5744 
_d5744 		one , two , three .
_d5744 
_d5744 		we only need one more (.) corner piece . 
_d5744 		so I see one and I think I'm gonna put it here cause [: because] I think it's gonna go there . 
_d5744 		hmmm . 
_d5744 		which part of the puzzle should we try next ? 
_d5744 		he:y ! 
_d5744 		that fits !
_d5744 
_d5744 		mmmm+hmmm , the next piece here needs to have +//. 
_d5744 		what is that ?
_d5744 
_d5744 		is that part of an animal or part of the tree ?
_d5744 
_d5744 		hmmm . 
_d5744 		hmmm , it needs to be a right edge piece cause [: because] this is a +//. 
_d5744 		hey what about that piece ?
_d5744 
_d5744 		oh , maybe not .
_d5744 
_d5744 		maybe that goes down there . 
_d5744 		that piece , does it go there ? 
_d5744 		he:y . 
_d5744 		okay , we nee:d to find that piece . 
_d5744 		well , we've done quite a bit , haven't we ? 
_d5744 		mmmm .
_d5744 
_d5744 		here's an +//.

_d5744 		here's what I think might be +//. 
_d5744 		hey , good job !
_d5744 
_d5744 		this might be a right edge piece . 
_d5744 		what do you think ?
_d5744 
_d5744 		I think this is part of an animal . 
_d5744 		so we need a right edge piece +/.
_d5744 
_d5744 		here is (.) an edge piece that has the same color as that . 
_d5744 		he:y !
_d5744 
_d5744 		o:h , yeah you're right . 
_d5744 		the little tip of that dino snout .
_d5744 
_d5744 		and that wouldn't be an edge piece , would it ?
_d5744 
_d5744 		that would just be a regular piece .
_d5744 
_d5744 		mmmm look for a tiny piece of snout . 
_d5744 		oh , is that a tiny piece of snout ? 
_d5744 		hmmm , I think this one . 
