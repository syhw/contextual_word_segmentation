_d6766 
_d6766 		remember when your mother told you to stop playing with your food ? 
_d6766 		that's the opposite of what goes on at the Minnesota zoo where zoo+keeper Ross Taylor encourages tigers to play with their food . 
_d6766 		Taylor often tosses tiger popsicles three pound meaty horse bones frozen inside heavy chunks of ice into the moat surrounding the tiger enclosure where two year old Maya and her siblings live . 
_d6766 		as soon as they hear a splash the tigers jump in . 
_d6766 		each cat grabs a popsicle while the others drag their treats to shore . 
_d6766 		Maya carries hers into deeper water . 
_d6766 		she has figured out that ice melts faster in the moat's water than it does in the air . 
_d6766 		her siblings have_to wait a couple of hours to enjoy their bone treats but Maya is gnawing on hers after only twenty minutes . 
_d6766 		this is one tiger that prefers fast food . 
_d6766 		this feeding technique encourages the big cats to swim something tigers enjoy in the wild . 
_d6766 		it also provides them with exercise and keeps helps keep them from becoming bored . 

_d6766 		modern zoos recognize that to stay healthy captive animals need exercise play interaction with other animals and interesting ways to eat . 
_d6766 		toy tool ? 
_d6766 		to keep him busy and distract him from expensive stuff like microphones researcher Patricia Cole gave Loki a miniature frisbee to play with . 
_d6766 		curious about how water was getting into Loki's dry food Cole set up video cameras to find out . 
_d6766 		she discovered that Loki had turned his toy frisbee into a tool . 
_d6766 		crows like their food moistened so the brainy bird used the frisbee to scoop water out of his bath pan and carry it to his food bowl where he poured it onto his chow . 
_d6766 		later Loki used a cup that Cole gave him . 
_d6766 		Loki developed this behavior all on his own says Cole but if I hadn't given him the frisbee it wouldn't have never happened . 
_d6766 		xxx . 
_d6766 		he figured that out he's smart huh ?
_d6766 
_d6766 		blast with bubbles ?
_d6766 
_d6766 		we didn't know what the reaction would be says elephant handler Sean Graham who blew bubbles from a machine he brought inside the elephant barn . 
_d6766 		five Asian elephants that Graham takes care of tore around chasing them like a bunch of excited kids . 
_d6766 		they opened their mouths stuck out their tongues and tried to catch the bubbles  ! 

_d6767 
_d6767 		like all spectacled bears boo+boo and Rosie go wild over fruit . 
_d6767 		you might think they'd squabble over it but these two cooperate . 
_d6767 		in the wild these bears browse for their food sniffing out the fruits they like to eat and climbing trees to get them . 
_d6767 		so the zoo+keepers drilled holes in an empty five gallon jug and filled it with apples grapes and raisins . 
_d6767 		to reach the food boo+boo and Rosie would have_to stand upright then spin the jug to make the food come out through the holes . 
_d6767 		Rosie stood up to reach the apparatus right away to get at the yummy smelling fruit . 
_d6767 		but boo+boo simply sniffed and then lay down under the climbing equipment with his paw out . 
_d6767 		all he had to do was wait for the food Rosie dropped as she spun the tumbler . 
_d6767 		I think he was capable of spinning the tumbler says Chris Waldren assistant curator of carnivores but he's clever enough that he gets her to do it . 
_d6767 		which she did and still does every time . 
_d6767 		Rosie does all the work and he gets all the treats . 
_d6767 		I think they've come to some sort of agreement perhaps or maybe one of these days Rosie will wake up hungry as a bear and it will be every mammal for himself . 
_d6767 		here's where they put the fruit see ? 
_d6767 		yep [: yes] . 
