_t4 		everyone wanted to see the big , big bridge . 
_t4 		it had towers so high that tops touched the sky . 
_t4 		and the valley beneath was so deep that when you were on the big , big bridge , you could barely see the ground ! 
_t4 		Thomas was excited about the new rail+line . 
_t4 		this is really a special day , he said happily . 
_t4 		look , who's this ? 
_t4 		is that Henry , and then Henry chugged up to Thomas +... 
_t4 		the big engine frowned . 
_t4 		I don't want to go to the mountains , Henry said nervously . 
_t4 		it's windy up there , very very windy . 
_t4 		Henry didn't like the wind . 
_t4 		Henry didn't like rain , or snow , or hail either . 
_t4 		we're a big engine Henry , Thomas said , you shouldn't be afraid of a little wind ! 
_t4 		but Henry was afraid . 
_t4 		that made Thomas a bit afraid too . 
_t4 		look at , there's everybody , who's this here ? 
_t4 		that's right ! 
_t4 		Gordon ,  +//.
_t4 
_t4 		Gordon , Henry , Thomas , hitch up your coaches , called sir Toppenhat . 
_t4 		it's time for your first trip to the mountains ! 
_t4 		Percy and James were glad they didn't have_to go to the mountains . 
_t4 		they were afraid to cross the bi:g , big bridge . 
_t4 		there's nothing to be afraid of , Thomas insisted +... 
_t4 		in a voice loud enough for Percy and James to hear . 
_t4 		it will be easy to cross the big , big bridge ! 
_t4 		ah , who's that ? 
_t4 		that's Thomas . 
_t4 		xxx , Thomas and Henry chugged to the platform , Gordon the express engine was already there ,   , excuse me .
_t4 
_t4 		his coaches were full of passengers . 
_t4 		Annie and Clarabelle were soon hitched behind Thomas . 
_t4 		hurry hurry , they called . 
_t4 		but they +//.
_t4 
_t4 		who's that ? 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		that's Thomas and that's the conductor . 
_t4 		that +//.
_t4 
_t4 		this is sir Toppenhat . 
_t4 		that was very good . 
_t4 		and this is the conductor . 
_t4 		all aboar:d ! 
_t4 		cried the conductor . 
_t4 		Sir Toppenhat turned to the crowd and waved his hat one last time . 
_t4 		toot+toot , Gordon whistled . 
_t4 		follow me ! 
_t4 		in a burst of steam , the big blue engine was off . 
_t4 		soon the trains were rolling through the country+side in a lo:ng line . 
_t4 		Gordon took the lead . 
_t4 		here's Gordon . 
_t4 		behind him chugged Henry , and then because he was the smallest ca:me +... 
_t4 		who's that ? 
_t4 		that's Thomas , that's right . 
_t4 		well all along the way , people came out of the house , and cheered when they saw the trains go by . 
_t4 		at the foot of the mountain , Henry slowed to a crawl . 
_t4 		these mountains are much too high , he moaned . 
_t4 		I can't go , I'm afraid of heights . 
_t4 		don't be silly , Thomas said bravely . 
_t4 		I'll be right here behind you . 
_t4 		but Henry didn't budge . 
_t4 		he was nervous . 
_t4 		that made (.) Thomas nervous too . 
_t4 		c'mon [: come on] , Thomas (.) gently pushed Henry . 
_t4 		we have_to go ! 
_t4 		the brand new tracks were smooth and shiny . 
_t4 		but Henry barely moved along them . 
_t4 		the truth was , Henry didn't want to reach the top of the mountain . 
_t4 		because then he'd have_to cross the big , big bridge . 
_t4 		if Percy and James and Henry are all afraid , thought Thomas , maybe I should be frightened too . 
_t4 		finally Thomas and Henry arrived at the top of the mountain . 
_t4 		there it was , what's that ? 
_t4 		xxx , that's right a bi:g , big bridge , and there's tracks on it too . 
_t4 		you're right . 
_t4 		and it was high ! 
_t4 		it was windy up there , too . 
_t4 		very windy . 
_t4 		I won't go , Henry declared . 
_t4 		but we have_to cross , Thomas said bravely . 
_t4 		our passengers want to see the mountains on the other side . 
_t4 		hurry hurry , Annie and Clarabelle cried . 
_t4 		the coaches were so excited that Thomas had trouble keeping them in line . 
_t4 		Thomas searched the tracks ahead . 
_t4 		Gordon was nowhere to be seen . 
_t4 		he had already crossed the big bridge and rolled into the mountains beyond . 
_t4 		Thomas and Henry were alone . 
_t4 		I'll go first , Thomas said at last . 
_t4 		then you can follow me , Henry ! 
_t4 		if the wind blows , close your eyes , Henry said , that way you won't see anything scary ! 
_t4 		here +... 
_t4 		what's this one say ? 
_t4 		click+clack , click+clack , click+clack , Thomas began to cross the bridge .

_t4 		his wheels came off the track . 
_t4 		right ? 
_t4 		xxx you alright Thomas , Henry called . 
_t4 		I'm stuck , Thomas said glumly , I couldn't see where I was going and my front wheels have jumped the track ! 
_t4 		just then Gordon returned and he frowned when he saw Thomas stuck in the middle of the bridge . 
_t4 		go find Harold , Gordon  cried to Henry . 
_t4 		relieved , Henry backed down the mountain to find the helicopter . 
_t4 		Thomas kept his eyes closed , he was too afraid to look . 
_t4 		but inside his coaches , the passengers enjoyed the wonderful view . 
_t4 		xxx , there he is , Harold was here to rescue him ! 
_t4 		slowly , Thomas opened his eyes , he looked at the blue sky above and the green mountains all around +... 
