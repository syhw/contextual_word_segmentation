_t4 		the animals led Snow White to a tiny cottage in the woods . 
_t4 		it's like a doll's house she said . 
_t4 		she knocked on the door but no one answered . 
_t4 		so she slowly stepped inside . 
_t4 		Snow White found seven tiny bowls seven tiny chairs and seven tiny beds . 
_t4 		but the cottage was a mess  my there must be seven tiny children living here . 
_t4 		let's clean the house and surprise them she said to her animal companions then maybe they'll let me stay . 
_t4 		that is a reindeer with his little antlers . 
_t4 		soon seven tiny men arrived the seven dwarfs . 
_t4 		Snow White promised to wash and sow and sweep for the little men and in return they kept her safe and happy . 
_t4 		the seven dwarfs loved having Snow White stay in their cottage . 
_t4 		back at the castle the magic mirror told the queen where Snow White was hiding . 
_t4 		the queen was so angry that she drank a potion that turned her into an old hag and she created a magic apple . 
_t4 		with one bite of this poisoned apple Snow White's eyes will close forever she said the only cure for the sleeping spell was love's first kiss . 
_t4 		as soon as the dwarfs went to work the queen disguised as a peddler woman approached Snow White the forest animals recognized the queen and ran off to warn the dwarfs . 
_t4 		oh no what's Snow White doing ? 
_t4 		right she's eating the apple . 
_t4 		and she fell to the floor in a deep sleep . 
_t4 		the evil queen fled from the cottage but the seven dwarfs raced after her . 
_t4 		they chased her to a rocky cliff and when a rock broke beneath her feet the queen fell from the mountaintop into the darkness below . 
_t4 		the broken hearted dwarfs watched over Snow White day and night one day the prince appeared as he had been searching for the beautiful princess . 

_t4 		as he approached the castle Malificent turned herself into a terrible dragon and blasted him with hot flames . 
_t4 		Philip threw his sword at the dragon with all his might and the beast plunged over the edge of the cliff . 
_t4 		prince Philip ran through the palace gates to where Aurora lay . 

_t4 
_t4 		come sit with me . 
_t4 		oh boy look what we have . 
_t4 		alright the little mermaid . 
_t4 		wow . 
_t4 		mommy has to yawn she's tired . 
_t4 		king Tritan forbade the mer people to go above the water but whenever his youngest daughter Ariel could she and her best friend Flounder would sneak up the surface . 
_t4 		Ariel was fascinated by the surface world and had a collection of human treasures . 
_t4 		she and Flounder had even made friends with a seagull named Scuttle . 
_t4 		one day Ariel saw a ship overhead and swam to the surface . 
_t4 		on board was a handsome young man called +... 
_t4 		prince Eric . 
_t4 		all of a sudden a storm broke and the sky turned dark thunder boomed and lightening crashed . 
_t4 		howling wind tore at the ship's sails and giant waves tossed the vessel onto the jagged rocks . 
_t4 		prince Eric was thrown into the ocean . 
_t4 		Ariel frantically searched for the prince and when she spotted him she quickly swam over to him and pulled him to safety . 
_t4 		once they were on shore Ariel sang quietly to the unconscious prince . 
_t4 		she has a very pretty voice was she singing ?
_t4 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		who else likes to sing ? 
_t4 		right .
_t4 
_t4 		who's that ? 
_t4 		Ursula .
_t4 
_t4 		is she nice or is she mean ? 
_t4 		she is mean .
_t4 
_t4 		meanwhile in a dark corner of the sea lay the lair of Ursula the sea witch she had been bent on destroying king Tritan ever since he had thrown her out of his kingdom . 
_t4 		when Ariel returned home Tritan was very angry with her . 
_t4 		never go there again he said and he +/.
_t4 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		but she said the prince must fall in love with you by sunset on the third day that is he's got_to kiss you . 
_t4 		if not +/.
_t4 
_t4 		well she's gonna +//.
_t4 
_t4 		Ursula took her mermaid tail away and gave her legs instead right ?
_t4 
_t4 		and if prince Eric didn't kiss her on the third day Ariel would change back into a mermaid and become Ursula's slave forever . 
_t4 		a short time later prince Eric and his dog Max found Ariel on the beach . 
_t4 		you seem very familiar to me he said have we met ? 
_t4 		Ariel could only nod although she looked like the girl who had rescued him it Eric thought it couldn't be her because she couldn't speak much less sing . 
_t4 		don't worry I'll help you said Eric and he brought Ariel back to his castle . 
_t4 		but meanwhile Ursula hatched a plan to keep Eric from falling in love with Ariel she turned herself into a pretty girl named +... 
_t4 		Vanessa right . 
_t4 		and she wore the shell containing Ariel's voice around her neck . 
_t4 		that evening the prince heard someone singing it was the voice of the girl who had saved him . 
_t4 		Eric went out to the balcony and saw Vanessa and fell under her wicked spell . 
_t4 		when Ariel awoke the next morning she saw Eric with Vanessa . 
_t4 		Ariel had lost her chance and was doomed to be Ursula's slave forever . 
_t4 		that's Deborah going to work . 
_t4 		aboard the wedding ship Scuttle saw Vanessa's reflection in the mirror and realized it was really Ursula . 
_t4 		Scuttle and the other seagulls did their best to interrupt the wedding by flying at Vanessa . 
_t4 		um . 
_t4 		this is one the ship . 
_t4 		um that looks like a little flower or something and this is some smoke maybe ? 
_t4 		oh that's right that's the necklace that broke you're absolutely right . 
_t4 		do you wanna  ? 
_t4 		it's okay .
_t4 
_t4 		I'll call her back . 
_t4 		um you can talk said prince you're the one it was you all the time . 
_t4 		happy at last the prince leaned over to kiss Ariel but seconds before the kiss the sun set . 
_t4 		you're too late shouted Ursula Ariel looked down and saw that her legs had changed back into a tail . 
_t4 		it's not you I'm after said Ursula I've got bigger fish to fry . 
_t4 		and at those words king Tritan appeared . 
_t4 		in return for his daughter's freedom the king agreed to take Ariel's place as Ursula's slave . 
_t4 		at last this is mine Ursula cried placing +...
_t4 
_t4 		right that's her +//.
_t4 
_t4 		that's Ariel's daddy's crown and his tritan . 
_t4 		and the bough of the ship pierced her cold heart slowly the horrible sea witch sank beneath the waves forever . 
_t4 		king Tritan's powers were restored and he realized how happy Eric and Ariel were . 
_t4 		with his tritan he changed Ariel's tail back into legs . 
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		how do you ask nicely ?
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		what's what's this one about ? 
_t4 		Belle . 
_t4 		and who's that ? 
_t4 		the beast . 
_t4 		a young woman named Belle lived near the castle . 
_t4 		Belle loved to read more than anything in the world . 
_t4 		who else loves to read ? 
_t4 		you do like to read . 
_t4 		uh her father Maurice was busy working on a new invention you'll win first prize at the fair tomorrow Belle predicted . 
_t4 		but Maurice and his horse Philippe never made it to the fair they got lost and saw a castle . 
_t4 		Maurice approached the castle and stepped inside . 
_t4 		say you'll marry me he said but Belle refused there was no way she'd marry that conceited bully . 
_t4 		Gaston left angrily . 
_t4 		just then Philippe arrived with no rider where's papa ? 
_t4 		you must take me to him +//.
_t4 
_t4 		I don't suppose she's French so maybe she just said where's papa huh . 
_t4 		Belle rode through the forest braving the thick fog and frightening sounds when she found the castle . 
_t4 		I'm the master of this castle roared the beast +/.
_t4 
_t4 		that's right . 
_t4 		take me instead of my father said Belle . 
_t4 		and the beast agreed there's the beast .
_t4 
_t4 		there he is .
_t4 
_t4 		you can go anywhere you like he said to Belle except the west wing and you will join me for dinner . 
_t4 		she'll always see me as a monster grumbled the beast . 
_t4 		but one day at dinner the beast remembered his manners and later he and Belle shared a wonderful dance . 
_t4 		the beast asked Belle if she was happy . 
_t4 		oh yes said Belle if only I could see my father . 
_t4 		so the beast brought Belle a magic mirror and her father appeared in it . 
_t4 		but he was wondering lost in the forest you must go to him said the beast sadly but take the mirror so you can remember me . 
_t4 		she left the castle and found her father and brought him home . 
_t4 		but suddenly Gaston arrived with an angry crowd your father's crazy he think thinks he's seen a beast . 
_t4 		but Belle had to convince everyone her father was not crazy so she picked up the magic mirror and showed the beast to the crowd . 
_t4 		Gaston locked Belle and her father in the cellar and set off to find the beast .
_t4 
_t4 		she's in her house . 
_t4 		Belle and her father escaped from the cellar and also began riding towards the castle . 
_t4 		when Belle and her father arrived the beast had Gaston by the throat . 
_t4 		let me go cried Gaston and the beast felt sorry for him and released him . 
_t4 		that's right they are wearing capes . 
_t4 		uh  right .
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		as the beast embraced Belle Gaston stabbed him in the back and the beast let out a terrible roar . 
_t4 		Gaston tripped and fell off the balcony and was never to be seen again . 
_t4 		the beast collapsed in Belle's arms you came back he said at least I got_to see you one more time . 
_t4 		Belle began to cry . 
_t4 		oh no please said Belle I love you . 
_t4 		and at Belle's words the beast  became human again . 
_t4 		it's me he said to Belle and all the household servants became human too . 
_t4 		the spell was broken at last . 
_t4 		yeah . 

_t4 		I of course would take full responsibility if it turned out it had no place in this house .
_t4 
_t4 		they're  , they're  turning colors .
_t4 
_t4 		well the thing about the commercial thing is that they use more (.)  (.) they give you more   of installing it .
_t4 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		so in other words ,  (.) this light already comes with a  in the residential , they only  .
_t4 
_t4 		which ones ?
_t4 
_t4 		uh+huh ,   I see .
_t4 
_t4 		they hurt ?
_t4 
_t4 		how did they get this thing in here ?
_t4 
_t4 		oh god .
_t4 
_t4 		I still just think it's so curious that you have_to put those in and not put any decent lighting in that room .
_t4 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		what'r'ya [: what are you] lookin' [: looking] at ? 
_t4 		oh you are .
_t4 
_t4 		look who I brought . 
_t4 		blankie .
_t4 
_t4 		blankie .
_t4 
_t4 		strawberries . 
_t4 		the purple crayon book ?
_t4 
_t4 		yes . 
_t4 		one evening after thinking it over for some time , Harold decided to go for a walk in the moonlight . 
_t4 		there wasn't any moon , and Harold needed a moon for a walk in the moonlight . 
_t4 		and he needed something to walk on . 
_t4 		he made a long straight path so he wouldn't get lost . 
_t4 		and he set off on his walk taking his big purple crayon with him . 
_t4 		but he didn't seem to be getting anywhere on the long straight path , so he left the path for a shortcut across a field . 
_t4 		and the moon went with him . 
_t4 		the shortcut led right to where Harold thought a forest ought_to be . 
_t4 		he didn't want to get lost in the woods so he made a very small forest . 
_t4 		how many trees are in this forest ? 
_t4 		yeah , just one tree ? 
_t4 		yeah , just one .
_t4 
_t4 		it turned out to be an apple tree . 
_t4 		the apples would be very tasty when they got red , Howard thought . 
_t4 		uh , o:h . 
_t4 		he put a frightening dragon under the tree to guard the apples .
_t4 
_t4 		he is going to scare Harold .
_t4 
_t4 		it was a terribly frightening dragon .
_t4 
_t4 		it frightened Harold , and he backed away . 
_t4 		his hand holding the purple crayon shook . 
_t4 		suddenly , he realized what was happening , but by then , Harold was over his head in an ocean . 
_t4 		he drew water . 
_t4 		but he came up thinking fast , and in no time he was climbing aboard a trim little boat . 
_t4 		he quickly set sail . 
_t4 		ooh boy , that's annoying , huh ? 
_t4 		op , it's gone . 
_t4 		I think it was a car alarm . 
_t4 		whadda [: what do] you think ? 
_t4 		it was a car ?
_t4 
_t4 		yeah , I think so .
_t4 
_t4 		he quickly set sail , and the moon sailed with him . 
_t4 		after he had sailed long enough , Harold made land without too much trouble . 
_t4 		he stepped ashore on the beach wondering where he was . 
_t4 		the sandy beach reminded Harold of picnics , and the thought of picnics made him hungry . 
_t4 		so he laid out a nice simple picnic lunch . 
_t4 		there was nothing but +... 
_t4 		pie .
_t4 
_t4 		but there were all nine kinds of pie that Harold liked best . 
_t4 		when harold finished his picnic there was quite a lot left . 
_t4 		he hated to see so much delicious pie go to waste . 
_t4 		so he left a very hungry +... 
_t4 		moose , and a deserving +...
_t4 
_t4 		porcupine to finish it up .
_t4 
_t4 		and off he went looking for a hill to climb to see where he was . 
_t4 		he knew that the higher up he went the farther he could see .
_t4 
_t4 		oh he's climbing up the mountain to see if he can find his bedroom .
_t4 
_t4 		oh he is ?
_t4 
_t4 		let's see .
_t4 
_t4 		he hoped he could see the bedroom from the top of the mountain . 
_t4 		oh !
_t4 
_t4 		he looked down over the other side and he fell off .
_t4 
_t4 		there wasn't any other side to the mountain . 
_t4 		he was falling into +... 
_t4 		thin air .
_t4 
_t4 		but luckily he kept his wits and his purple crayon . 
_t4 		and he made a hot air balloon and grabbed on . 
_t4 		he made a basket under the balloon big enough to stand in . 
_t4 		he had a fine view from the balloon but he couldn't see his window . 
_t4 		he couldn't even see his house . 
_t4 		so he made a house with windows and landed the balloon on the grass in the front yard . 
_t4 		none of the windows was his window though . 
_t4 		he tried to think where his window ought_to be .
_t4 
_t4 		oh , it must be in back of the house , I bet it's back behind the house , right ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		he made some more windows . 
_t4 		he made a big building full of windows .
_t4 
_t4 		he made lots_of buildings full of windows . 
_t4 		he made a whole city of windows .
_t4 
_t4 		but none of the windows was his window . 
_t4 		and he couldn't think where it might be . 
_t4 		he decided to ask a policeman . 
_t4 		the policeman pointed the way Harold was going anyway , but Harold thanked him . 
_t4 		and he walked along with the moon wishing he was in his room and in his bed . 
_t4 		then +... 
_t4 		he remembered .
_t4 
_t4 		he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon . 
_t4 		it was always right around the moon . 
_t4 		yeah the window is right around the moon .
_t4 
_t4 		then Harold made his bed and got in and drew up the covers . 
_t4 		the purple crayon dropped on the floor and Harold +... 
_t4 		dropped off to sleep .
_t4 
_t4 		very good sweetie .
_t4 
_t4 		very good .

_t4 		yeah , you did ?

_t4 
_t4 		one night Harold got up , made sure there was a moon so he wouldn't see things in the dark +... 
_t4 		and went to get a drink of water . 
_t4 		he wondered about the things people see in the dark and where they came from . 
_t4 		he was glad he couldn't see them in the moonlight . 
_t4 		suddenly he realized he didn't see anything at all in the moonlight , there was nothing to see . 
_t4 		he was in the middle of a desert . 
_t4 		no wonder he was so thirsty . 
_t4 		but luckily he had brought his purple crayon , and he knew where to find water on the desert . 
_t4 		there was always a pool of it somewhere near a palm tree . 
_t4 		Harold drank deeply . 
_t4 		there's [: there is] nothing like drinking nice cool water on a desert . 
_t4 		but there isn't much else to do on a desert +... 
_t4 		Harold realized as he looked around , except maybe play in the sand . 
_t4 		then he remembered how the  +//. 
_t4 		then he remembered how the government has fun on the desert . 
_t4 		it shoots off rockets . 
_t4 		nineteen+fifty+six book . 
_t4 		Harold decided to go to the moon . 
_t4 		on a good fast rocket he figured he could get there and back in time for breakfast . 
_t4 		he fired the rocket and off he went . 
_t4 		xxx but the rocket missed the moon . 
_t4 		it missed it by a mile ! 
_t4 		and Harold went up and up +... 
_t4 		up and +/.
_t4 
_t4 		there's the moon !
_t4 
_t4 		but he was going up up up in the dark . 
_t4 		where's he gonna land ? 
_t4 		he tried to see where he was going by looking at the stars . 
_t4 		he tried planets and comets , what he really needed to light his way was another moon . 
_t4 		when Harold looked closely what he saw wasn't a moon , it was a flying saucer . 
_t4 		Harold had heard about flying saucers , people saw them in the dark +... 
_t4 		(a)n(d) nobody knew who was inside flying them . 
_t4 		he decided he'd [: he had] better land his rocket right away . 
_t4 		and landed it with a bump on the bottom of a strange planet . 
_t4 		there was no danger falling off so big a planet +... 
_t4 		however Harold thought he would feel a little bit more comfortable at the top of the planet . 
_t4 		he wondered what planet he was on . 
_t4 		in the dark light of the stars he looked for some sign that might tell him . 
_t4 		xxx what planet is he on ? 
_t4 		is he on Jupiter ? 
_t4 		he's on Mars .
_t4 
_t4 		Harold had heard of men on Mars so he yelled a couple of hellos hopefully . 
_t4 		he thought of the flying saucer out there and thought of the things that people see in the dark . 
_t4 		he felt a great need for some company . 
_t4 		he was sure any man on Mars would be cordial to a visitor like Harold who had come all this way to chat with him . 
_t4 		he had to draw on his scanty knowledge of what a man on Mars looked like . 
_t4 		but his looks wouldn't really matter in the dark so Harold didn't care much what he turned out to look like . 
_t4 		all Harold wanted to know was there was some sort of friendly face close by . 
_t4 		then all of a sudden Harold did see it clearly +... 
_t4 		it was the face of a thing . 
_t4 		it was a thing people see in the dark and it was sitting on a flying saucer . 
_t4 		and Harold ran away . 
_t4 		and he thought and stopped . 
_t4 		probably the thing was about to fly to Earth and scare somebody maybe a little child . 
_t4 		so bravely Harold crept back . 
_t4 		he approached on tiptoe so the thing wouldn't hear him . 
_t4 		and he reached out with his purple crayon +... 
_t4 		and he put a completely damaging crack in the flying saucer . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		before the thing could grab him he was off again chuckling triumphantly . 
_t4 		and ran as fast as he could in the dark . 
_t4 		happily most of the way was downhill . 
_t4 		he hoped he wouldn't fall head over heels . 
_t4 		he arrived safely heels over head at the bottom of Mars where the rocket was . 
_t4 		but by this time Harold had had enough of adventure , he wanted to get home in a dependable way . 
_t4 		so he climbed down on the stars . 
_t4 		it was sure but it was slow . 
_t4 		and the points of the stars hurt Harold's feet . 
_t4 		Harold wished he were home . 
_t4 		and he recalled the best way to wish on a +//. 
_t4 		is on a good big shooting star .
_t4 
_t4 		instead of wishing it occurred to him at the last moment to jump aboard . 
_t4 		he shot right down to +//. 
_t4 		what planet does Harold live on ?
_t4 
_t4 		well he was visiting Mars but what planet do we live on ? 
_t4 		Earth right !
_t4 
_t4 		he shot right down to Earth where he made a neat two+point landing . 
_t4 		he hadn't passed the moon on the way and he wondered what happened to it , it wasn't anywhere around . 
_t4 		then he realized the night was just about gone and it was time for the sun to come up . 
_t4 		he was very hungry . 
_t4 		the sun appeared right on time . 
_t4 		it came up big and bright +... 
_t4 		and Harold remarked it was going to be a very nice day . 
_t4 		nobody was even bothered by flying saucers and things in the sunshine . 
_t4 		but for a startled moment he thought he saw a flying saucer . 
_t4 		it was on the horizon looking as if it had just come in to land . 
_t4 		he was mistaken though it wasn't a saucer it was an oatmeal bowl . 
_t4 		xxx Harold happened to like hot breakfasts and he quickly drew up a chair . 
_t4 		and sat down to +...
_t4 
_t4 		eat .
_t4 
_t4 		yummy he's going to eat his breakfast . 
_t4 		xxx what did you have for breakfast ? 

_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		this is not Mommy's favorite book .
_t4 
_t4 		but I'll read it anyway . 
_t4 		the abridged version . 
_t4 		Laney Lamb and Lily Bunny were best friends . 
_t4 		everyday they met in the wildflower meadow just as the warm spring sun first sparkled on the morning dew . 
_t4 		hooray squealed Lily she hopped even higher than before did a somersault and landed gracefully in the soft spring grass . 
_t4 		awesome cried a strange deep voice . 
_t4 		there was a bright green frog . 
_t4 		that was excellent he croaked . 
_t4 		oh hello Fritz said Laney . 
_t4 		hi said Fritz the frog I hope I'm not interrupting you . 
_t4 		this is my friend Lily Bunny Laney said . 
_t4 		oh nice to meet you Fritz croaked . 
_t4 		but Lily just nodded at Fritz and looked away . 
_t4 		she didn't like the thought of sharing the meadow and her friend with a stranger . 
_t4 		Lily scowled she wanted Laney to pay attention to her . 
_t4 		but Laney was so busy performing for Fritz she didn't hear . 
_t4 		all that morning Laney played with Fritz while Lily stayed by herself at the far end of the me(adow) meadow . 
_t4 		come on Lily , Laney bleated Fritz is picking watercress for us and it's [: it is] delicious . 
_t4 		Lily stamped one of her big back feet and glared angrily at Laney . 
_t4 		look she said you can play with that frog all you want but if you're going to be friends with him you can't be friends with me . 
_t4 		why said Laney feeling very sad and confused . 
_t4 		because said Laney that's [: that is] just the way it is . 
_t4 		the next morning Lily didn't go to the wildflower meadow but went to have breakfast on the other side of the grassy hill . 
_t4 		and there she met Penelope Pig . 
_t4 		well here's [: here is] a surprise I thought you'd [: you would] be with Laney . 
_t4 		you're best friends aren't you ? 
_t4 		we were but now she wants to play with some frog . 
_t4 		well maybe I can help said Penelope I know a lot about friends and friendship . 
_t4 		the little what ? 
_t4 		little lamb ?
_t4 
_t4 		oh the little piggy . 
_t4 		yeah there's the Penelope Pig . 
_t4 		ah if I'm not mistaken you're upset because Laney wants to play with Fritz but it's perfectly fine to have more than +/.
_t4 
_t4 		she is big . 
_t4 		it's perfectly fine to have more than one good friend at a time . 
_t4 		friendship is the perfect thing to share and having more friends mean having more fun . 
_t4 		Penelope walked away leaving Lily alone . 
_t4 		Penelope thinks she's so smart Lily thought but she doesn't understand . 
_t4 		Lily started to eat but the plants were not as sweet as the ones by the pond . 
_t4 		and she heard the laughter and shouting of two voices . 
_t4 		she saw Laney and Fritz picking flowers together . 

_t4 
_t4 		what color are they ? 
_t4 		xxx o:h . 
_t4 		late one summer afternoon , Lisa and her mother took their laundry to the laundromat . 
_t4 		as always on such trips , Lisa took along her toy bear , Corduroy . 
_t4 		xxx a laundromat was a busy place at this hour . 
_t4 		now , Corduroy , you sit right here and wait for me , Lisa said . 
_t4 		I'm going to help with our wash .
_t4 
_t4 		Corduroy waited patiently (.) then he suddenly perked up his ears . 
_t4 		you don't want your precious things to get all wet and soapy . 
_t4 		pockets , said Corduroy to himself . 
_t4 		I don't have a pocket .
_t4 
_t4 		he slid off the chair . 
_t4 		I must go find something to make a pocket out of , he said , and he began to look around .
_t4 
_t4 		first he came to a pile of fancy towels and wash+cloths , but nothing was the right size or color . 
_t4 		then he saw a huge stack of colorful clothes in a laundry basket . 
_t4 		there ought_to be something in there to make a pocket out of , he said . 
_t4 		without hesitating , he climbed inside the bag , which was filled with pieces of wet laundry . 
_t4 		the dampness didn't bother Corduroy in the least . 
_t4 		this must be a ca:ve , he said , sighing happily . 
_t4 		I've always wanted to live in a dark , cool cave .
_t4 
_t4 		when the time came for Lisa to fetch her bear , he was gone ! 
_t4 		oh Mommy , she said , Corduroy isn't here where I left him ! 
_t4 		I'm sorry , Honey , said her mother , but the Laundromat will be closing soon and we must be getting home . 
_t4 		Lisa was reluctant to leave without Corduroy , but her mother insisted . 
_t4 		you can come back tomorrow , she said . 
_t4 		I'm sure he will still be here .
_t4 
_t4 		before he knew it , Corduroy was being tossed together with all the sheets and shirts and shorts and slacks +... 
_t4 		into the dryer .
_t4 
_t4 		but just as the artist was shutting the glass door , Corduroy tumbled out onto the floor . 
_t4 		how in thunder did that bear ever get mixed up with my things , the artist wondered . 
_t4 		poor Corduroy was damp all over . 
_t4 		the least I can do for him is give his overalls a good drying , said the man thoughtfully . 
_t4 		Corduroy grew dizzy as he watched the clothes spinning round , but the artist became inspired . 
_t4 		this would make a wonderful painting , he said as he took out his sketch+pad and began drawing the swirling colors . 
_t4 		I can hardly wait to get back to my studio . 
_t4 		finally , the dryer stopped whirling and the man gathered up the clothes . 
_t4 		and he helped Corduroy put on his warm , dry overalls . 
_t4 		all at once , the manager of the laundromat called , closing time , everybody out . 
_t4 		Corduroy was gently placed on top of a washing machine . 
_t4 		I wonder who that bear belongs to , said the artist as he was leaving . 
_t4 		it seems to me he should have his name someplace . 
_t4 		he's too fine a fellow to be lost . 
_t4 		as soon as the lights were turned off , Corduroy began searching +//. 
_t4 		began his search again . 
_t4 		he was surprised to see something white glowing in the dark . 
_t4 		what is it ?
_t4 
_t4 		maybe it's snow , he said . 
_t4 		I've always wanted to play in the snow .
_t4 
_t4 		he accidentally tipped over the open+lidded box and suddenly he was covered in soft , slippery soap flakes .
_t4 		it's soap ! 
_t4 		gradually , Corduroy began to slip and slide . 
_t4 		what fun , he said with a smile ! 
_t4 		I've always wanted to ski down a steep mountainside .
_t4 
_t4 		he landed paws first in an empty laundry basket . 
_t4 		this must be a cage , he said . 
_t4 		I've never wanted to live inside a cage . 
_t4 		but by now , Corduroy was drowsy , and soon he nodded off to +... 
_t4 		oh , he's sleeping .
_t4 
_t4 		next morning , when the manager came to open the door of the laundromat , Lisa was waiting . 
_t4 		I left something here yesterday , she said . 
_t4 		may I look around ?
_t4 
_t4 		certainly , said the manager . 
_t4 		my customers are always leaving things .
_t4 
_t4 		Lisa was searching under the chairs and in back of the washing machines when he +//. 
_t4 		when he +//.
_t4 
_t4 		when she heard the manager call her . 
_t4 		is this whatchor [: what you're] looking for , senorita ?
_t4 
_t4 		xxx yes , he's my best friend , shouted Lisa as she came running ! 
_t4 		she reached in and picked Corduroy out of the basket . 
_t4 		so this is where you've been , you little rascal , she said . 
_t4 		it's time I took you home .
_t4 
_t4 		Lisa thanked the manager and ran out of the door , down the street , holding Corduroy tightly in her arms . 
_t4 		why did you wander away , she said ? 
_t4 		I went looking for a pocket , said Corduroy . 
_t4 		oh , Corduroy , why didn't you tell me you wanted a pocket , asked Lisa , giving him an affectionate squeeze . 
_t4 		the very next morning , Lisa sewed a pocket on Corduroy's overalls . 
_t4 		and here's a card I've made with your name on it for you to keep tucked inside . 
_t4 		that's his little pocket . 
_t4 		I've always wanted a purple pocket with my name inside , said Corduroy as he and Lisa nuzzled noses .
_t4 
_t4 		that's some thread .
_t4 
_t4 		that Lisa used to sew the pocket on . 
_t4 		wow . 
