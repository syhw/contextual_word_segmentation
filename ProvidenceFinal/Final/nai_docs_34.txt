_d5770 		in the basement ? 
_d5770 		xxx , yes .
_d5770 		yeah he has a lotta [: lot of] messed up papers down there that's true . 
_d5770 		okay .
_d5770 		well , we could use regular chairs for his desk chair . 
_d5770 		and we could make this , this could be his desk .
_d5770 		we could put two of these together to make his desk . 
_d5770 		like that . 
_d5770 		that's about the size of his desk and we could put a chair there . 
_d5770 		here's , here's a  here's a green chair .
_d5770 		you know we could build it and then we could slide it underneath after we build it . 
_d5770 		what do you think ? 
_d5770 		what else is in his office ?
_d5770 		the base+plate . 
_d5770 		but while we're building it we can keep it right here if we want to . 
_d5770 		kay [: okay] . 
_d5770 		what else does he have down here ? 
_d5770 		the treadmill ? 
_d5770 		okay . 
_d5770 		this block almost look like a treadmill if it was this way . 
_d5770 		not really ?
_d5770 		that's true , it doesn't have a hold in it . 
_d5770 		hmmm +... 
_d5770 		the treadmill also has like two handles . 
_d5770 		doesn't it ? 
_d5770 		kind of like you know to go up to the side that he holds onto , I thought I would make that part . 
_d5770 		wait wait wait wait , wait wait . 
_d5770 		(be)cause I thought you know like he , when he walks on the treadmill +... 
_d5770 		he holds on . 
_d5770 		right ? 
_d5770 		yeah . 
_d5770 		and then there's a bar across them . 
_d5770 		let's get one more ye(llow) small yellow lego . 
_d5770 		to go here . 
_d5770 		and then something goes across that he +... 
_d5770 		I don't really +... 
_d5770 		huh . 
_d5770 		something is wrong with this lego . 
_d5770 		so it can kinda [: kind of] , doesn't this kinda [: kind of] look like the treadmill ? 
_d5770 		well that's , I think it looks kinda [: kind of] like the treadmill .
_d5770 		then he has  , he has a sofa right here doesn't he ? 
_d5770 		next to his desk ? 
_d5770 		a pink one ? 
_d5770 		do you need to use the potty ? 
_d5770 		okay . 
_d5770 		let's go look . 
_d5770 		the one that's a pull+out sofa that great+grandma slept on when she was with us . 
_d5770 		it pulls out . 
_d5770 		and turns into a bed . 
_d5770 		yeah , you know which one I mean ? 
_d5770 		should we make that ? 
_d5770 		you're right . 
_d5770 		could we use red instead maybe ? 
_d5770 		you're right there are no pink legos . 
_d5770 		there does that kinda [: kind of] look like that's a sofa ?
_d5770 		that's part of the sofa . 
_d5770 		I'm pretending that's the part that you sit on and this is the back of the sofa . 
_d5770 		I'm just pretending . 
_d5770 		this is the part to lean against , that's what I was thinking .
_d5770 		and you sit like this .
_d5770 		if the doll was there she'd be , she'd sit like this . 
_d5770 		on the sofa . 
_d5770 		this is a non+functioning lego . 
_d5770 		yup [: yes] , push . 
_d5770 		yeah push .
_d5770 		yeah yup [: yes] .
_d5770 		watch Mommy do it .

_d5770 		Bib(by) +/.
_d5770 		Bibby and Bobby . 
_d5771 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_d5771 		would you , are you interested in sitting on your bed and reading a book and having some quiet time ?
_d5771 		it might be nice .
_d5771 		because it's kind of nap time for you .
_d5771 		oh build a guest bedroom , okay .
_d5771 		here's a bed . 
_d5771 		how (a)bout right over here ?
_d5771 		guests sleep over here .

_d5771 		like this , table was on this side . 
_d5771 		xxx .
_d5771 		this side . 
_d5771 		the table that holds magazines and things . 
_d5771 		and I think maybe there's even +... 
_d5771 		is there a little table on this side too ? 
_d5771 		xxx .
_d5771 		yeah ?
_d5771 		all+right . 
_d5771 		xxx .
_d5772 		okay . 
_d5772 		did you see that I put the water colors and papers out for whenever you're ready ? 
_d5772 		to paint with the water colors .
_d5772 		yeah there might be just one , I don't remember . 
_d5772 		if there's two or one . 
_d5772 		it's still snowing out , look . 
_d5772 		you can see some snow falling still . 
_d5772 		(be)cause the lights aren't on . 
_d5772 		and it's a dark day , it's not a sunny day . 
_d5772 		all+right , here we are ! 
_d5772 		oh , there are two tables see ! 
_d5772 		one on that side +... 
_d5772 		and one on that side . 
_d5772 		and there are two lamps too .
_d5772 		you could do that . 
_d5772 		and there's the chair in the guest bedroom also .
_d5772 		okay .
_d5772 		yeah .
_d5772 		all+right .
_d5773 		is your neck itchy ? 
_d5773 		why don't you walk up the stairs ?
_d5773 		(be)cause it's got a zipper . 
_d5773 		here , hold still for a second . 
_d5773 		okay , leave that there . 
_d5773 		please . 
_d5773 		you wanna unzip it all the way ? 
_d5773 		okay , i'll move the microphone then . 
_d5773 		okay , just a sec(ond) . 
_d5773 		all+right . 
_d5773 		all+right . 
_d5773 		you don't have_to inhale it . 
_d5773 		let's go upstairs . 
_d5773 		inhale means to breathe . 
_d5773 		you looked like you were breathing in the microphone . 
_d5773 		I don't know . 
_d5773 		oh , that's what you were doing . 
_d5773 		yes ,  you're in luck . 
_d5773 		Naima , I'm gonna check and see if there's any laundry I need doing , I'll be right back . 
_d5773 		just to the washing machine . 
_d5774 		hi . 
_d5774 		hey , where's your microphone . 
_d5774 		oh brother . 
_d5774 		oh Naima .
_d5774 		all+right , where is it honey ?
_d5774 		on the floor , okay . 
_d5774 		okay .
_d5775 		you wanna do the painting now ? 
_d5775 		because I thought that it might be easier if I give you one color and then another and then another . 
_d5775 		because that way the colors you won't get all  , all mixed up on the brush . 
_d5775 		which is what sometimes happens . 
_d5775 		well , there's actually some water right there . 
_d5775 		and there's also some on top , so there's some in there +... 
_d5775 		yeah , ooh . 
_d5775 		yeah , of course not , you can take as long as you want . 
_d5775 		thank you sweetie . 
_d5775 		you can let me know if you decide you want another color . 
_d5775 		okay . 
_d5775 		which color would you like next ? 
_d5775 		umm purple , green , blue , orange , red . 
_d5775 		brown . 
_d5775 		you want brown , okay . 
_d5775 		I'll get you brown . 
_d5775 		and then after you're done with brown you can pick out another color . 
_d5775 		there's red .
_d5775 		he says wed with a w .
_d5775 		yeah .
_d5776 		Wodney wat . 
_d5776 		some toddlers can't . 
_d5776 		well because even when you're a little kid you're still learning how to talk , aren't ya [: you] ? 
_d5776 		it's not so easy . 
_d5776 		to learn how to talk ? 
_d5776 		it's a very difficult thing . 
_d5776 		yup [: yes] , that's another way you can do it all+right . 
_d5776 		oh , what color would you like next ? 
_d5776 		&er wed , or red ? 
_d5776 		red .
_d5776 		okay . 
_d5776 		let me have that brush . 
_d5776 		and I will get you the red now . 
_d5776 		do you like that Wodney wat story ? 
_d5776 		yeah .
_d5776 		why does the title of the book say Wodney wat instead of Rodney rat ? 
_d5776 		the title of the book uses +...
_d5776 		the way Wodney says his name . 
_d5776 		because it's about him it doesn't use +... 
_d5776 		what probably his parents probably say Rodney rat , right ?
_d5776 		well they aren't toddlers , they probably can pronounce their r's .
_d5776 		properly .
_d5777 		well , grown+ups usually can pronounce things . 
_d5777 		it's just that when you're little and growing up , some things are hard to pronounce . 
_d5777 		it's hard to twist your mouth in that just+the+right way . 
_d5777 		don't you think ? 
_d5777 		do you think it's hard to say some words ? 
_d5777 		what words do you think it's hard to say ? 
_d5777 		there's water right in there . 
_d5777 		yup [: yes] , the paint gets into the water and colors the water red . 
_d5777 		he does ?
_d5777 		he can't ?
_d5778 		hmmm +... 
_d5778 		the hairs keep all the dirt out . 
_d5778 		and other things from getting up into your nose and your throat . 
_d5778 		well if you didn't have all the little hairs in your nose , then you might get big pieces of dust or little pieces of dirt up in your throat . 
_d5778 		(be)cause your nose is actually connected to your throat . 
_d5778 		okay . 
_d5778 		oh .
_d5778 		with a tail ! 
_d5778 		oh .
_d5778 		oh my .
_d5778 		a blue ear above ?
_d5779 		blue air above ,  , like sky you mean ? 
_d5779 		here's some black . 
_d5779 yeah I gave you a different brush (be)cause the other one it looked like the pieces of the brush were coming out on your paper because you were banging the brush on the paper 
_d5779  see how there's little pieces of brush on your paper ?
_d5779 		on your painting ? 
_d5779 		what things are black ? 
_d5779 		well sometimes the sky can look black if there's a storm coming . 
_d5779 		it's usually a very , very dark grey not actually black . 
_d5779 		but at night sometimes the sky can look black . 
_d5779 		when it's nighttime . 
_d5779 		okay .
_d5780 		the animal eats the black thing ? 
_d5780 		oh . 
_d5780 		that's all+right . 
_d5780 		I'll clean it up . 
_d5780 		when you're done with the painting . 
_d5780 		oh . 
_d5780 		oh , the black stuff is stuff inside the animal's nose .
_d5780 		oh .
_d5781 		which pink part ? 
_d5781 		oh . 
_d5781 		that's where its nose is ? 
_d5781 		huh . 
_d5781 		uh+huh . 
_d5781 		okay . 
_d5781 		oh .
_d5781 		hmmm .
_d5781 		oh , so the sky has dark parts and blue parts ?
_d5781 		wow , look at all the snow in the sky right now .
_d5781 		my+goodness ! 
_d5781 		it's really snowin [: snowing] . 
_d5781 		you want some blue now ? 
_d5781 		okay . 
_d5781 		should I take that ? 
_d5781 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_d5781 		that's part of the sky ? 
_d5781 		yeah .
_d5781 		it's getting to be dark , yeah .
_d5781 		um I think the , you haven't had the green or the orange or the purple , but you've had the other colors . 
_d5781 		yeah okay , hold on .
_d5781 		what do you think sometimes is +/?
_d5781 		yeah .
_d5781 		funny shaped grapes ?
_d5782 		that are not good to eat ? 
_d5782 		oh that are good to eat .
_d5782 		sometimes the sky can be purple , what other things are purple ?
_d5782 		the sky can be purple+ish if there's a nice sunset . 
_d5782 		and some flowers are purple . 
_d5782 		let's see +... 
_d5782 		let me get you the purple . 
_d5782 		are you all done with the blue ? 
_d5782 		do you want me to get the purple or are you still painting with the blue ? 
_d5782 		okay .
_d5782 		do you want me to get the purple for you ? 
_d5782 		when you're done with that +...
_d5782 		yup [: yes] , you can call them pictures or paintings . 
_d5782 		yup [: yes] !
_d5782 		well they're pictures . 
_d5782 		you could say your painting a picture or you could say your painting a painting . 
_d5782 		(be)cause painting means what you're doing , but it also means what it is you painted . 
_d5782 		yeah , I think that's probably what we say in this house , we say you're painting a painting . 
_d5782 		or your painting a picture . 
_d5782 		I guess maybe we say both . 
_d5782 		here is the purple . 
_d5782 		sky can be purple sometimes if there is sunset . 
_d5782 		and it's more that it's purplish , it's not usually bright purple . 
_d5782 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_d5782 		oh boy . 
_d5783 		are you done with the purple ? 
_d5783 		you wanna keep the purple there and I'll give you some orange ? 
_d5783 		I'll give you a separate , I'll give you a different +... 
_d5783 		brush for the orange , so that the orange and the purple don't get all mixed together . 
_d5783 		so I'll put the orange all the way over here , let me get some water for that . 
_d5783 		let's see +... 
_d5783 		okay . 
_d5783 		now I'll actually move this down here since you're mostly done with the purple . 
_d5783 		now you can use the brush for the orange . 
_d5783 		oh , sun .
_d5783 		yes , sometimes it is !
_d5783 		well +... 
_d5783 		usually it's part of a sunrise colors or sunset colors you can see orange . 
_d5783 		I think green is the only one you haven't had . 
_d5783 		okay . 
_d5783 		don't paint on the table please . 
_d5783 		you can use this brush for the green . 
_d5783 		can you think of anything ? 
_d5783 		no ? 
_d5783 		when you go outside what things do you see that are green outside ? 
_d5783 		ahh , yes . 
_d5783 		grass . 
_d5783 		yes .
_d5784 		would you like another piece of paper ? 
_d5784 		you mean you're done painting that one ? 
_d5784 		okay .
_d5784 		wow . 
_d5784 		oh , all+right .
_d5784 		do you need a little water next to the green ? 
_d5784 		looks like it . 
_d5784 		here . 
_d5784 		oop(s) , a little too much ! 
_d5784 		that's for me ? 
_d5784 		yay .
_d5784 		I'm gonna come look at it . 
_d5784 		do you want me to write anything on it or do you wanna just leave it without any writing on it ? 
_d5784 		would you like another piece of paper ?
_d5784 		hmmm +... 
_d5784 		mmmm .
_d5784 		yeah , it needs sometime to dry . 
_d5784 		lemme [: let me] get you some paper . 
_d5784 		I'm gonna get you a smaller piece this time . 
_d5784 		okay .
_d5784 		so now you have three colors . 
_d5784 		you have orange , green and purple all together there . 
_d5784 		well , so that you don't mix the colors up . 
_d5784 		if you use one brush for the orange and then you use the same brush for the green +...
_d5784 		the colors will mix+up and probably become some version of brown . 
_d5784 		sometimes you wanna do that , but you may not wanna [: want to] do that all the time . 
_d5784 		so this way you can use more than one brush . 
_d5784 		one for each color if you want to . 
_d5784 		uh+huh .
_d5784 		ahh .
_d5784 		and what color are you finding that you make when you do that ? 
_d5784 		what would you call the combination color ? 
_d5784 		I was peeling carrots , and slicing them . 
_d5784 		woo+peeling them ?
_d5784 		no , I was actually peeling them . 
_d5785 		hmmm . 
_d5785 		making some lines +... 
_d5785 		hmmm . 
_d5785 		hmmm . 
_d5785 		well , when he comes home you can tell him about combining the colors . 
_d5785 		it's seems like I do get a picture , almost every day you've given me one . 
_d5785 		it's very nice to have them . 
_d5785 		really ? 
_d5785 		he's at work . 
_d5785 		you know , those brushes really are shedding their , their brush , their +... 
_d5785 		these aren't very good brushes . 
_d5785 		(be)cause they're just coming out . 
_d5785 		the  bristles , these are called the bristles . 
_d5785 		the bristles just are coming right out . 
_d5785 		are you done with this one , do you want me to put it aside ?

_d5794 		the receiver is what's attached to the camera . 
_d5794 		today is February third (.) and we're just about one week late in recording .

_d5809 		not (un)til you're quite a big kid , and even then we probably wouldn't .

_d5848 		yeah . 
_d5848 		I will march with you .
_d5848 		I wanna turn off the  .
_d5848 		oh like the obstacle course that we had at gym class .
_d5848 		where we pretended it was a beach . 
_d5848 		we did different things with the frisbees . 
_d5848 		right ? 
_d5848 		getting impatient ? 
_d5848 		okay . 
_d5848 		almost done here . 
_d5848 		&aw . 
_d5848 		it's hard isn't it it really is .
_d5848 		okay .
_d5848 		don't talk to me like that please .
_d5848 		I'm coming , I'm gonna turn off the receivers and the camera the transmitters and the camera now , okay .
_d5848 		xxx .
_d5848 		uh , I think I have_to open the door .
_d5849 		the (.)  barn into the veterinary hospital ? 
_d5849 		can we take some of the animals out to make special stalls for the sick animals ? 
_d5849 		what do you think ? 
_d5849 		let's [: let us] take them out so that there's room for the +//.
_d5849 		yes I know .
_d5849 		I know . 
_d5849 		that's what he's doing right now . 
_d5849 		why don't you take the animals out and we'll have a veterinary hospital in the barn ? 
_d5849 		and +//.
_d5849 		okay . 
_d5849 		oh ,  !
_d5850 		you mean like a (.) i+v fluid is what you mean . 
_d5850 		o:h , great idea . 
_d5850 		yep [: yes] , animals might need special water . 
_d5850 		oh is that (.)  (.) bees+wax ? 
_d5850 		I'm making more room on the floor and taking down the trains . 
_d5850 		yeah . 
_d5850 		it might be hard to get that out actually . 
_d5850 		do you want that to come out ? 
_d5850 		do you want me to help you ? 
_d5850 		I think we need something to take it out , like a chopstick or something very narrow that could poke it out .
_d5850 		I might need a special tool to take out that wax . 
_d5850 		no , something very narrow . 
_d5850 		like a pen even , or +... 
_d5850 		something very small . 
_d5850 		oh , you took it out ! 
_d5850 		oh no , there's still a little bit in there . 
_d5850 		good , it's not soft right now .
_d5850 		there . 
_d5850 		now it's all out .
_d5850 		should I take that ? 
_d5850 		okay . 
_d5850 		great . 
_d5850 		&u:h , so +... 
_d5850 		the tree's [: tree is] gonna be the treadmill at the veterinary hospital ?
_d5850 		o:h .
_d5850 		okay . 
_d5850 		Pushpa is the veterinarian , okay .
_d5850 		okay . 
_d5850 		that's a good question . 
_d5850 		I think so .
_d5850 		that tree is a painted tree . 
_d5850 		that , I think , is a willow tree , isn't it ?
_d5850 		it's a certain kind of a tree that grows near the water . 
_d5850 		and what ? 
_d5850 		yeah .
_d5850 		it could be growing near the pond at the farm . 
_d5850 		mmmm , to hold the base of the tree . 
_d5850 		well , there's two pieces of wood making up that tree . 
_d5850 		there's this part , and there's this part , and this is attached to this with the screws .
_d5850 		I think it's supposed to be the grass under the tree . 
_d5850 		I think that's what that's supposed to be . 
_d5850 		yeah ?
_d5850 		okay . 
_d5850 		okay , here's the doctor . 
_d5850 		oh , he's the veterinarian ?
_d5850 		okay . 
_d5850 		let's [: let us] see . 
_d5850 		who's going to bring the sick animal ? 
_d5850 		who's the sick animal now ? 
_d5850 		which +//?
_d5850 		all of them ? 
_d5850 		okay . 
_d5850 		well , in the morning the doctors probably have_to do their rounds . 
_d5850 		that means they visit all the sick patients .
_d5850 		oh , so what happens at nighttime at the veterinary hospital ? 
_d5850 		curl up ? 
_d5851 		her mother is a doctor ? 
_d5851 		I'll be right back . 
_d5851 		I'm gonna look something up , Naima . 
_d5851 		so , only about five minutes has elapsed since I stopped recording . 
_d5851 		when I played it back I heard a little interference that then went away , so I'm hoping it's not major interference . 
_d5851 		okay . 
_d5851 		let's see what's happening with these animals .
_d5851 		yeah ?
_d5851 		o:h .
_d5851 		okay , that's the receipt .
_d5851 		okay .
_d5852 		yeah . 
_d5852 		okay , we can play that when we get home from gym class , sure .
_d5852 		okay .
_d5852 		do you want to keep playing  veterinary hospital now ? 
_d5852 		all+right . 
_d5852 		all+right o:h , is this a sick mouse ? 
_d5852 		okay . 
_d5852 		where's the veterinarian ?
_d5852 		I think this this person is gonna bring the mouse into the veterinary hospital .
_d5853 		well , I'm bringing this mouse , which is sick , to the doctor and say this mouse seems to have a hurt tail . 
_d5853 		this is my pet mouse , and it has a hurt tail .
_d5853 		can you examine (.) my mouse and figure out what the problem is with the tail ?
_d5853 		and maybe bandage the tail ?
_d5853 		okay . 
_d5853 		there's not even  +//.
_d5853 		you mean which door is for which stall ? 
_d5853 		oh it's hard when they're open to figure it out , isn't it ? 
_d5853 		these are the stalls that are veterinary hospital . 
_d5853 		is this the  veterinary hospital ? 
_d5853 		okay . 
_d5853 		okay , does the mouse need some medicine ? 
_d5853 		and who else is an animal who's [: who is] gonna be brought to the veterinary hospital ? 
_d5853 		this little cow hit its ear on a speaker at the concert ? 
_d5853 		o:h . 
_d5853 		well maybe this little calf needs its ear examined . 
_d5853 		and the mother is coming along with it to keep it company . 
_d5853 		and here's the doctor .
_d5853 		what does the doctor say ?
_d5853 		mmmm .
_d5853 		okay . 
_d5853 		well , should I come back to check on my cows in the morning ? 
_d5853 		okay .
_d5853 		goodby:e . 
_d5853 		goodbye . 
_d5853 		there's a stall for you I think , where you can be while you're getting better here at the veterinary hospital . 
_d5854 		a colt ? 
_d5854 		it hit its nose on Pushpa ? 
_d5854 		o:h .
_d5854 		does it need a nose bandage ? 
_d5854 		oh , dear . 
_d5854 		that's quite +//. 
_d5854 		is that something like a concert injury ?
_d5854 		I see .
_d5854 		oh , and my horse and my colt are here at the veterinary hospital , too . 
_d5854 		and I know they will take good care of them , so I will go back to the farm and do farm+work while they are here being (.) treated by the veterinarians .
_d5854 		treated well by the veterinarians . 
_d5854 		okay , I've [: I have] got_to go back and feed my other animals here . 
_d5854 		the veterinary hospital could have a barn cat , who lives here , who isn't sick who just lives here all the time . 
_d5854 		xxx .
_d5854 		mmmm . 
_d5854 		what's wrong with the cat ? 
_d5854 		it licked too much milk ?
_d5854 		oh .
_d5854 		huh . 
_d5854 		did it get a tummy+ache from that ? 
_d5854 		I see . 
_d5854 		o:h .
_d5854 		okay .
_d5855 		Pushpa , what are you going to do ? 
_d5855 		you gonna examine the cat ?
_d5855 		Pushpa is the veterinarian , isn't she ? 
_d5855 		yeah .
_d5855 		you can't do it ? 
_d5855 		what does she do ?
_d5855 		what's she gonna do to examine it ? 
_d5855 		oh .
_d5855 		shall we get some medicine made out of bees+wax up here ? 
_d5855 		here's some cat medicine . 
_d5855 		when cats get upset tummies , they can have that kind of medicine . 
_d5855 		cause that's the +//. 
_d5855 		that's how it normally is .
_d5855 		once I warmed it up in the oven and it all melted together and all the colors ran together .
_d5856 		and  came that time . 
_d5856 		xxx . 
_d5856 		are you gonna warm it up right there ?
_d5856 		it's gonna take it a while , take it a long time to warm up .
_d5856 		xxx .
_d5856 		in the night ?
_d5857 		you mean when it falls out of my clothes ? 
_d5857 		I think we're gonna need to get dressed to go to the gym class soon .
_d5857 		cause otherwise we're gonna miss it .
_d5857 		very soon , though . 
_d5857 		let's [: let us] play this for five more minutes and then we'll get on (.) some +//. 
_d5857 		you could even wear your leotard if you want to .
_d5857 		would you like that ?
_d5858 		what else happens at a veterinary hospital ? 
_d5858 		do the animals that are patients there get fed every day ?
_d5858 		you think so ?
_d5858 		oh .
_d5858 		but when they're sick they can't eat ? 
_d5858 		are they gonna get some special water ? 
_d5858 		do any of them need i+v fluids ?
_d5858 		okay .
_d5858 		hmmm . 
_d5858 		good !
_d5858 		o:h , do we need a little container of milk on it ? 
_d5858 		um maybe we could get some white bees+wax . 
_d5858 		do we have a tiny little bowl somewhere , Naima ? 
_d5858 		a tiny , tiny bowl ? 
_d5858 		yeah , it's not really warm enough right now . 
_d5858 		ah , this'll [: this will] make some good milk . 
_d5858 		this is warm now , if you wanna make some medicine out of that . 
_d5858 		I'll make some milk out of this one . 
_d5858 		I don't have any good place to put that .
_d5858 		here , I'm gonna warm this white part up and make some milk out of it . 
_d5858 		can you find a little dish for the cat to eat from ? 
_d5858 		mmmm well we need to use that . 
_d5858 		I guess you can use that for a little while .
_d5858 		yes .
_d5858 		here's the milk .
_d5859 		no this is white milk . 
_d5859 		there you go . 
_d5859 		mmmm now the cat can have some milk . 
_d5859 		oops ! 
_d5859 		xxx .
_d5859 		the cat fell upside down in the big milk bowl . 
_d5859 		that's gonna be a wet cat ! 
_d5859 		toweled dry .
_d5859 		don't ya [: you] think ? 
_d5859 		let's [: let us] check this .
_d5859 		(o)kay , that seemed to be recording very nicely .

_d5860 		let me feel your belly .
_d5860 		oh yes , I feel the lantern in there . 
_d5860 		but those are very tiny lanterns , aren't they ? 
_d5860 		are you their mother ? 
_d5860 		how big was the lantern ? 
_d5860 		oh .
_d5860 		I think they'll probably poop it out . 
_d5860 		who was there when they swallowed the lanterns , their mothers or their father ? 
_d5860 		a babysitter was there ? 
_d5860 		o:h .
_d5860 		o:h .
_d5860 		o:h .
_d5861 		oh , and they couldn't take them out quickly , huh ?

_d5861 		okay , let's [: let us] get it some medicine .
_d5861 		its mother is taking it away from the medicine ?

_d5862 		well , the doctor will come back in the room when the bear is ready to have medicine .
_d5862 		the doctor has so many patients to see . 
_d5862 		the doctor can't wait .
_d5862 		oh , good .
_d5862 		I see .

_d5863 		I sure am .
_d5863 		what song doesn't he like ?
_d5863 		how does he know what song is gonna be there at the gym class ? 
_d5863 		are you talking about Cape Cod gymnastics ?
_d5863 		they do play loud music there . 
_d5863 		that's one of the things I don't like about that gym class .
_d5863 		but this one , I don't know if there's music or not . 
_d5863 		we'll just have_to go and find out .
_d5863 		but we do have_to get ready .
_d5863 		o:h , don't play with that , it's not a toy . 
_d5863 		okay , what I'd like you to do is take off your big kid pants and +...

_d5864 		all+right .
_d5864 		well , dogs eat dog+food , but we can find out more about dog food . 
_d5864 		okay , all+right .
_d5864 		we'll find out about +... 
_d5864 		o:h . 
_d5864 		is he gonna put the milk in a little pail ?
_d5864 		I wonder if I could make a pail out of +//. 
_d5864 		oh , you're right , baby cows don't have udders .
_d5864 		calves don't have udders . 
_d5864 		maybe I could make a milking pail (.) out of bees+wax .
_d5865 		the animals are  . 
_d5865 		oh , there's a price tag on this .
_d5865 		hmmm . 
_d5865 		no . 
_d5865 		let's [: let us] see . 
_d5865 		well , you know what we can make out of the yellow bees+wax is  .
_d5865 		xxx soft  . 
_d5865 		xxx against my body . 
_d5865 		we have_to wait til  soften up . 
_d5865 		um , some farm animals like to eat things like corn cobs , from corn+on+the+cob , leftover cobs . 
_d5865 		uh , I don't know if cows like that in particular , but (.) I think some other animals do . 
_d5865 		hello . 
_d5865 		hi guys .
_d5865 		oh , I hope you're having fun .
_d5865 		it's nice and bright in here . 
_d5865 		isn't it ?
_d5865 		it's very nice  .
_d5865 		I'm coming to say bye . 
_d5865 		I was downstairs .
_d5865 		and now I'm going to the office for a little while .
_d5865 		thank+you . 
_d5865 		have fun , baby+o . 
_d5865 		bye . 
_d5865 		what are you thinking , a couple hours , or an hour , or what ? 
_d5865 		well , you know I have +//.
_d5865 		it's almost four .
_d5865 		about five six seven hours of work , so I'm gonna do +//.
_d5865 		okay .
_d5865 		probably an hour+and+a+half , be home by five+thirty , six .
_d5865 		okay .
_d5865 		here's a corn cob .
_d5866 		one of the animals can eat the corn cob . 
_d5866 		you know , we could look up which animals eat corn cobs . 
_d5866 		I know that pigs like them .
_d5866 		I'm not sure if horses are allowed to eat corn cobs or not . 
_d5866 		we could look that up .
_d5866 		why , you're right , it's not very soft , cause I didn't put this one in my bra . 
_d5866 		I'm trying to make these without doing that . 
_d5866 		I was gonna make a milking pail with the black bees+wax . 
_d5866 		is it ? 
_d5866 		no .
_d5866 		that one wasn't . 
_d5866 		here , you can roll it just the way you roll play+doh . 
_d5866 		did you know that ? 
_d5866 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_d5866 		xxx , if you hold them in your hand even for a little while , it will get , actually +... 
_d5866 		I've actually started putting things in here , in my (.) in the waist of my pants . 
_d5866 		I think that's pretty hard . 
_d5866 		is it ?
_d5866 		maybe cause it's been in your hand for a little while . 
_d5866 		whose job is it to feed the animals (.) at your farm ? 
_d5866 		it's his job ? 
_d5866 		oh , the baby doesn't belong there .
_d5866 		why don't you put the baby in the cradle ? 
_d5866 		put it there , or in your bed maybe . 
_d5867 		an unmouthed baby ? 
_d5867 		cause it doesn't have a mouth ? 
_d5867 		xxx , I think that's just so that you can imagine the mouth that it has . 
_d5867 		sometimes it takes a while for these things to warm up . 
_d5867 		I was just handling that one . 
_d5867 		I just made that corn cob .
_d5867 		I was gonna make the pail now . 
_d5867 		you were handling that ?
_d5868 		and it got warm ? 
_d5868 		no I wasn't , but that's a very thin piece , so it probably wouldn't take much to warm it . 
_d5868 		put it against your belly and see if it warms up quickly .
