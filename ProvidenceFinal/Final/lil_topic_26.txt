_t9 		on a sunny Saturday morning dandelion +...
_t9 
_t9 		that's his daddy . 
_t9 		you're right . 
_t9 		Dandelion woke up stretched and yawned and jumped out of bed . 
_t9 		after doing his daily exercises . 
_t9 		Dandelion looked out of the window . 
_t9 		blinked his eyes and said I wonder if the mail has come . 
_t9 		he put on his sweater and went outside to the mail box . 
_t9 		there was a letter and it was written in fancy gold ink . 
_t9 		dear Dandelion you are invited to my tea and taffy party on Saturday afternoon at half passed three . 
_t9 		come as you are . 
_t9 		sincerely Jennifer Giraffe . 
_t9 		Dandelion was very excited . 
_t9 		it's a good thing I'm getting a hair cut today he said . 
_t9 		as soon as he washed and dried the dishes . 
_t9 		and made his bed nice and neat . 
_t9 		he ran down the street to the barber shop . 
_t9 		Lou Kangaroo had a chair waiting for him . 
_t9 		and then gave him a shampoo . 
_t9 		Dandelion thought he should have a manicure to . 
_t9 		right he's cleaning his nails . 
_t9 		when Lou Kangaroo had finished Dandelion looked a bit foolish . 
_t9 		xxx silly . 
_t9 		maybe a wave would help Lou suggested showing him a picture in the latest fashion magazine for lions . 
_t9 		Dandelion agreed . 
_t9 		this was exactly what he needed . 
_t9 		so Lou went about curling his mane . 
_t9 		he looked +...
_t9 
_t9 		magnificent . 
_t9 		but now +...
_t9 
_t9 		magnificent . 
_t9 		but now Dandelion thought he'd +...
_t9 
_t9 		magnificent . 
_t9 		magnificent . 
_t9 		very good honey . 
_t9 		but now Dandelion thought he really should wear something more elegant than a sweater to the party . 
_t9 		this jacket is the very newest style said Theodore the tailor . 
_t9 		and it just fits you . 
_t9 		all you need now is a cap and a cane . 
_t9 		Happy Crane will be happy to help you . 
_t9 		what a damper dandy he had suddenly become .
_t9 
_t9 		that's Happy Crane . 
_t9 		it's nearly half past three said Dandelion . 
_t9 		I've just time to get something for my hostess . 
_t9 		a bouquet of dandelions would be perfect . 
_t9 		he knew this tall door very well . 
_t9 		having been here many times before . 
_t9 		he rang the bell . 
_t9 		when Jennifer Giraffe opened the door she looked very surprised . 
_t9 		yes she said . 
_t9 		what can I do for you ? 
_t9 		but I'm here for your party he said . 
_t9 		why I'm sorry sir you are not anyone I know she said . 
_t9 		you must have the wrong address . 
_t9 		and with that she closed the door right in poor Dandelion's face . 
_t9 		I'm Dandelion he roared you've made a mining mistake . 
_t9 		but the door stayed tight shut . 
_t9 		Dandelion walked back and forth down the block . 
_t9 		and as he paced +...
_t9 
_t9 		he is sad .
_t9 
_t9 		the sky grew dark . 
_t9 		and a sudden gust of wind sprang up and blew away his beautiful bouquet . 
_t9 		they blew away in the wind . 
_t9 		oh no . 
_t9 		to make matters worse it began to rain in ? 
_t9 		Torrance . 
_t9 		Dandelion dropped his cane . 
_t9 		and stood under a weeping willow tree . 
_t9 		but the rain pored down through the branches . 
_t9 		Dandelion was soon soak and wet and his curls came unfurled . 
_t9 		he took off his jacket . 
_t9 		and hung it on a willow branch . 
_t9 		luckily he had kept on his sweater . 
_t9 		at last the rain stopped . 
_t9 		and the warm sunshine came down . 
_t9 		huh while he sat there waiting he spotted three dandelion flowers .
_t9 
_t9 		more dandelions . 
_t9 		they had been protected .
_t9 
_t9 		they didn't blow away . 
_t9 		they had protected from the wind and rain . 
_t9 		he picked the dandelions and said I think I will try again . 
_t9 		and rang the bell . 
_t9 		well if it isn't our friend Dandelion . 
_t9 		we've been waiting for over an hour for you . 
_t9 		I do hope you weren't caught in that awful cloud burst . 
_t9 		everyone at the party greeted him hardly . 
_t9 		and Jennifer Giraffe told Dandelion about the silly looking lion that had come to the door . 
_t9 		Dandelion almost spilt his cup of tea . 
_t9 		that was me I was the silly looking one .
_t9 
_t9 		what's he drinking ? 
_t9 		is it delicious ? 
_t9 		oh yummy . 
_t9 		Miss Giraffe was so flustered she got herself tangled in her ? 
_t9 		pearl necklace .
_t9 
_t9 		I promise I will never do such a thing again she said . 
_t9 		and I promise you I will never again try to turn myself into a stylish dandy said Dandelion . 
_t9 		from now on I'll always be just +... 

_t0 		and he always carried a miniature first aid kit in his back pocket . 
_t0 		just in case . 
_t0 		you definitely have a mind of your own said Chester's mother . 
_t0 		that's one way to put it said Chester's father . 
_t0 		Chester's best friend Wilson was exactly the same way . 
_t0 		that's why they were best friends . 
_t0 		Chester wouldn't play baseball unless Wilson played and they never swung at the first pitch or slid head first . 
_t0 		Wilson wouldn't ride his bicycle unless Chester wanted to and they always used hand signals . 
_t0 		if Chester was hungry Wilson was to . 
_t0 		but they rarely ate between meals . 
_t0 		some days I can't tell those two apart said Wilson's mother . 

_t0 		for Halloween they would always dress as things that went together . 
_t0 		salt and pepper shakers two mittens on a string . 
_t0 		ham and eggs . 
_t0 		they really are two peas in a pod said Chester's mother . 

_t0 		let's not hurt your teeth okay honey . 
_t0 		she wore band+aids all over her arms and legs to look brave . 

_t0 		and she never left the house without one of her nifty disguises . 
_t0 		Lily waved at all the cars that passed by even if she didn't know who was in them . 
_t0 		and she always carried a loaded squirt gun in her back pocket just in case . 
_t0 		she definitely has a mind of her own said Chester . 
_t0 		that's one way to put it said Wilson . 
_t0 		when Lily asked Chester and Wilson to play they said they were busy . 
_t0 		when she called them at home they disguised their voices and said they weren't home . 
_t0 		if Lily was walking on one side of the street Chester and Wilson crossed to the other side and hid . 
_t0 		she's something else said Chester . 
_t0 		looks like it said Wilson . 
