_t4 		oh see they don't know he swallowed his key chain .
_t4 
_t4 		they just know that he's very sick . 
_t4 		it was a little hard to explain why I put a key chain in my mouth . 
_t4 		I hope that you never do anything like that it'll be very bad for you they took me to the hospital what do you see in the hospital here ? 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		what do you think that is ?
_t4

_t4 		you had some special water going into your body when you were in the hospital remember ? 
_t4 		okay what happens next I had a big room all to myself . 
_t4 		the nurse took off my scarf and put a white gown on me . 
_t4 		don't worry she said we'll take a good care of you it wouldn't hurt . 

_t4 		why don't we give Daddy a call . 
_t4 		you wanna take off that sticker ?
_t4 
_t4 		that's the price sticker .
_t4

_t4 		you need your hair elastic fixed . 
_t4 		well that you took off the whole sticker .
_t4 
_t4 		that's not a sticker that's the that's printed on the book . 
_t4 		hey do you wanna try to start  making a new bedtime poster tonight ? 
_t4 		we could do that . 
_t4 		yeah you took all the things off of it though so we need to make a new one that says what what we do at night time . 
_t4 		alright one more time and then I think you done on the potty . 
_t4 		ah all this is is the title of the book Gospal in the hospital . 
_t4 		last summer I was Gospal the dog dog walker when our neighbors went on vacation I walked their dogs . 
_t4 		and guess what I bought with the money they gave me . 
_t4 		did he buy dog food ? 
_t4 		hmmm did he ? 
_t4 		did he buy a tricycle ? 
_t4 		oh a key+chain with a little race car . 
_t4 		everyone at school wanted it but it was mine . 
_t4 		he's in school he's an animal who goes to school . 
_t4 		I was scared that someone would steal it well I'm not dumb I knew the perfect place to hide it I put the key+chain in my mouth . 
_t4 		but gulp  no I swallowed it . 
_t4 		I think he did gulp it . 
_t4 		oh my god .
_t4 
_t4 		oh you think he chewed it . 
_t4 		oh maybe he did he definitely swelled though . 
_t4 		suddenly I felt very sick . 
_t4 		he really doesn't feel well . 
_t4 		what happened Gospal said the teacher but I didn't answer I was afraid to tell her about my key+chain . 
_t4 		I think he's [= he] may be embarrassed . 
_t4 		well he wishes he hadn't swallowed the key+chain . 
_t4 		she called an ambulance . 
_t4 		the ambulance put me on a stretcher . 
_t4 		this is the stretcher . 
_t4 		they asked me what happened but I still didn't want to tell . 
_t4 		it was a little hard to explain why I put a key+chain in my mouth . 
_t4 		well that's a good question I don't know I guess may be he thought the other children liked it very much . 
_t4 		they took me to the hospital  those are the ambulance people . 
_t4 		see there he's on the stretcher they're carrying him in . 
_t4 		ah: let see .
