_d3351 
_d3351 		and I lifted the future king up high for all to see . 
_d3351 		not far from the ceremony in a cave at the backside of Pride rock , a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled , life's [: life is] not fair , I shall never be king . 
_d3351 		moments later Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave . 
_d3351 		Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba , you should have been first in line . 
_d3351 		I was first in line until the little hair+ball born , and with that Scar stalked out of the cave . 
_d3351 		before long , Simba grew into a healthy , playful young cub . 
_d3351 		early one morning , he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock . 
_d3351 		as they looked out at the rising sun , Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands . 
_d3351 		look Simba , everything the light touches is our kingdom . 
_d3351 		what about that shadowy place , said Simba . 
_d3351 		that's beyond our borders , you must never go there , Simba . 
_d3351 		later as Simba headed back to the path , he ran into Scar . 
_d3351 		hey uncle Scar , guess what , I'm going to be king of Pride rock , my dad showed me the whole kingdom . 
_d3351 		he didn't show you what's beyond the rise at the northern borders , said Scar . 
_d3351 		well no , he said I can't go there . 
_d3351 		oh he's right , only the bravest lions go there , said Scar . 
_d3351 		come on , said Simba , I just heard about this great place . 
_d3351 		Simba pounced on Nala and Nala flipped Simba on his back . 
_d3351 		they tumbled down the hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones . 
_d3351 		we're way beyond the boundary of Pride ro(ck) +//.
_d3351 
_d3351 		of the Pride lands , said Nala . 
_d3351 		and we're in danger . 
_d3351 		suddenly , three hyenas slithered out of the eye sockets of an elephant skull . 
_d3351 		a trio of trespassers , said the hyenas . 
_d3351 		while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom , (.) Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with a swipe of his big paw . 
_d3351 		I'm very disappointed in you Simba , you deliberately disobeyed me , he said . 
_d3351 		I was just trying to be brave like you . 
_d3351 		being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble , said Mufasa . 
_d3351 		Dad , we're pals right , we'll always be together , won't we ? 
_d3351 		Simba , said Mufasa , let me tell you something my father told me . 
_d3351 		look at the stars , the great kings of the past look down on us from the stars . 
_d3351 		so whenever you feel alone , just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you , and so will I . 
_d3351 		meanwhile , Scar went to visit the hyenas . 
_d3351 		I practically gift+wrapped those cubs for you and you couldn't even dispose of them . 
_d3351 		Scar warned the hyenas to be prepared for the death of the king . 
_d3351 		the following day , Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge . 
_d3351 		when they arrived , Scar turned to his young nephew . 
_d3351 		your father has a marvelous surprise for you , he said .
_d3351 
_d3351 		wildebeests . 
_d3351 		didn't it +//?

_d3351 		right ? 
_d3351 		that's exciting . 
_d3351 		Mufasa took off to save his young son . 
_d3351 		but he plunged into the gorge and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests . 
_d3351 		he found Simba , grabbed him by the nape of his neck and pulled him to a nearby ledge . 
_d3351 		suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede . 
_d3351 		desperately he tried to cli(mb) +//.
_d3351 
_d3351 		climb another ledge from which Scar stood looking down on him . 
_d3351 		help me Brother , he said . 
_d3351 		but Scar let go of Mufasa and he fell down . 
_d3351 		it was an accident , said Scar , I didn't mean for it to happen . 
_d3351 		what am I going to do , said Simba . 
_d3351 		run away Simba , said Scar , run away and never return . 
_d3351 		Scar returned to Pride rock to take over the throne . 
_d3351 		meanwhile , Simba plodded across the savannah without any food or water . 
_d3351 		and it wasn't long before he fainted under the hot sun . 
_d3351 		he's so cute , can't we keep him ? 

_d3377 		up the trunk to the nest where the little egg +... 

_d3377 		it poured and it lightninged , it thundered and rumbled . 
_d3377 		this isn't much fun , the poor elephant grumbled . 

_d3377 		and icicles hung from his trunk and his +... 

_d3393 		almost all of them have broad flat leaves . 
