_d3910 		alright , we 
_d3910 		(o)kay . 
_d3910 		great , who lives in New york ? 
_d3910 		well who lives in New york , since we're reading about New york ? 
_d3910 		and who else ? 
_d3910 		uh huh ?
_d3910 
_d3910 		that's right , they all live in New york .
_d3910 
_d3910 		do you know where Grandma  told me that she and Papa  were going ?
_d3910 
_d3910 		they're going to Greece . 
_d3910 		yeah , that'd [: that would] be fun , it's very far away . 
_d3910 		you wanna go with me one day ? 
_d3910 		(o)kay , they're going to a wedding ! 
_d3910 		exciting ,  ? 
_d3910 		my name is Becky , and I live near the New york public library . 
_d3910 		some buildings in New york make you feel small . 
_d3910 		but walking up the steps of the library makes me feel important . 
_d3910 		we should go to the library next time we're in . 
_d3910 		wouldn't that be a great idea ? 
_d3910 		it's like walking up the steps of a palace , especially if you walk exactly in the middle . 
_d3910 		xxx all the people . 
_d3910 		the library was my favorite place in New york when we first moved here . 
_d3910 		my mother painted me a map . 
_d3910 		you can see it in the front of this book . 
_d3910 		here it is . 
_d3910 		she's an artist and she painted all the other pictures too . 
_d3910 		she said that once a week , we could go wherever I wanted to . 
_d3910 		if I could figure out how to get there . 
_d3910 		for my first expedition , I wanted to see real animals . 
_d3910 		finding a zoo on the map was easy . 
_d3910 		knowing where I was on the map , and which way to walk to the zoo was a little harder . 
_d3910 		but I finally figured it out by turning the map . 
_d3910 		once the map and I were both facing the same direction , finding the zoo was easy . 
_d3910 		have you been to the zoo ? 
_d3910 		yes you have . 
_d3910 		one good thing about New york is that most of the streets are numbered in order . 
_d3910 		the numbers go up as you go north , and down as you go south . 
_d3910 		it's very logical . 
_d3910 		so we just walked straight on fifth avenue . 
_d3910 		I know I was going the right way because the numbers kept going up . 
_d3910 		and at sixty+fourth street , we turned left . 
_d3910 		sometimes zoos make you feel sorry for the animals that live in them , but at this one , most of the animals aren't in cages . 
_d3910 		the penguins have rocks to climb on , and make their nests with , and a pool to swim in . 
_d3910 		you can stand right next to the glass and see under the water ! 
_d3910 		they were my favorites , but I also liked watching the insects . 
_d3910 		I saw a leaf cutter ant , bite off a leaf and carry it all the way back to its nest . 
_d3910 		what was your favorite thing at the zoo , do you remember ? 
_d3910 		yeah , do you remember the polar bears ? 
_d3910 		wasn't there a polar bear named Lily ? 
_d3910 		that's pretty neat , huh ? 
_d3910 		yeah . 
_d3910 		tell me if you want me to take your plate , okay ? 
_d3910 		do you want me to take it ? 
_d3910 		no ? 
_d3910 		yes ? 
_d3910 		I'm just gonna put it over here , okay ? 
_d3910 		while I take a sip of my coffee . 
_d3910 		wow , what's this ? 
_d3910 		a ferris wheel ? 
_d3910 		oh a carousel , yes it's true .
_d3910 
_d3910 		after the zoo , we explored the park and found a carousel . 
_d3910 		I chose a big black horse with a lion saddle . 
_d3910 		it wasn't like riding a real horse but it was kind of fun anyway . 
_d3910 		the horse went up and down when the music started . 
_d3910 		I had three rides . 
_d3910 		I thought that was a silly name for a big black horse with a roaring lion saddle . 
_d3910 		hmmm+hmmm . 
_d3910 		when I wanted to get a birthday present for my friend Martin , my parents said they were going to the twenty+sixth street antiques fair , and that I could look for one there . 
_d3910 		they had a lot of antique toys , like a china dog and a wooden horse , but I didn't think Martin would really like those . 
_d3910 		I did find him some old baseball cards for his collection though . 
_d3910 		Mommy used to work right around here . 
_d3910 		it's true . 
_d3910 		yeah , the twenties . 
_d3910 		who loves cheesecake ?
_d3910 
_d3910 		I do love cheesecake , hmmm+hmmm ! 
_d3910 		my mother said they had the best cheesecake in New york . 
_d3910 		his grandchildren work there , in little aprons . 
_d3910 		dogs were everywhere , because a fancy dog show was going on across the street . 
_d3910 		I like the dobermans , and a little black bulldog . 
_d3910 		there's the dobermans , and there's the little black bulldog I guess . 
_d3910 		oh ,  , I think that is a cat . 
_d3910 		where's the little black bulldog , I wonder ? 
_d3910 		xxx , have you and Daddy already discussed this ?
_d3910 
_d3910 		xxx . 
_d3910 		no ?
_d3910 
_d3910 		that one's [: one is] not a bulldog , you're right .

_d3910 		should I get them now , or should I read some more first ? 
_d3910 		read some more first ? 
_d3910 		okay . 
_d3910 		do you know what this is ? 
_d3910 		is it a big boat ?
_d3910 
_d3910 		what's it called ? 
_d3910 		after cheesecake , we went to the Intrepid . 
_d3910 		you can see where kamikaze planes crashed into it . 
_d3910 		yikes . 
_d3910 		the fighter jets are real too , you can climb up platforms and look inside them . 
_d3910 		it was a very cold , windy day , and we had the whole huge deck almost to ourselves . 
_d3910 		Martin ran around acting and sounding like a plane until other people came out , so then we went inside . 
_d3910 		we got_to work the controls in the simulated cockpit with pilot and copilot seats . 
_d3910 		and Martin loved it . 
_d3910 		uh . 
_d3910 		woo . 
_d3910 		look at that , do you remember what the name of that building is ?
_d3910 
_d3910 		that's the Empire state building .
_d3910 
_d3910 		the next week we went to the observation deck of the Empire state building . 
_d3910 		we stepped onto it just at that magical moment when the city and bridge lights are on , but the sky still has some of the sunset in it and it's not quite dark . 
_d3910 		you could see so far . 
_d3910 		in the painting we are looking north , with the Hudson river on our left and the East river on our right . 
_d3910 		the small green square in the distance is Central park . 
_d3910 		here we go , wow . 
_d3910 		ah , look , there's Central park . 

_d3910 		mhm ?
_d3910 
_d3910 		that's the Hudson river , and the East river . 
_d3910 		some birds flying . 
_d3910 		Martin's mother was curious about these expeditions of ours , so for our next one , we went to Wall street , where she works . 
_d3910 		we met her on the spot where george Washington was sworn in as our first president . 
_d3910 		do you remember where you saw a thing about george Washington ? 
_d3910 		Liberty's kids , right .
_d3910 
_d3910 		do you know who used to work right around Wall street ? 
_d3910 		actually , who used to work on Wall street ? 
