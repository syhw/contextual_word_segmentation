_d3160 		once they were on shore Ariel sang quietly to the unconscious prince . 
_d3160 		she has a very pretty voice was she singing ?
_d3160 
_d3160 		yeah . 

_d3160 		is she nice or is she mean ? 
_d3160 		she is mean .
_d3160 
_d3160 		meanwhile in a dark corner of the sea lay the lair of Ursula the sea witch she had been bent on destroying king Tritan ever since he had thrown her out of his kingdom . 
_d3160 		when Ariel returned home Tritan was very angry with her . 
_d3160 		never go there again he said and he +/.

_d3161 
_d3161 		Ursula took her mermaid tail away and gave her legs instead right ?
_d3161 
_d3161 		and if prince Eric didn't kiss her on the third day Ariel would change back into a mermaid and become Ursula's slave forever . 
_d3161 		a short time later prince Eric and his dog Max found Ariel on the beach . 
_d3161 		you seem very familiar to me he said have we met ? 
_d3161 		Ariel could only nod although she looked like the girl who had rescued him it Eric thought it couldn't be her because she couldn't speak much less sing . 
_d3161 		don't worry I'll help you said Eric and he brought Ariel back to his castle . 
_d3161 		but meanwhile Ursula hatched a plan to keep Eric from falling in love with Ariel she turned herself into a pretty girl named +... 
_d3161 		Vanessa right . 
_d3161 		and she wore the shell containing Ariel's voice around her neck . 
_d3161 		that evening the prince heard someone singing it was the voice of the girl who had saved him . 
_d3161 		Eric went out to the balcony and saw Vanessa and fell under her wicked spell . 
_d3161 		when Ariel awoke the next morning she saw Eric with Vanessa . 
_d3161 		Ariel had lost her chance and was doomed to be Ursula's slave forever . 
_d3161 		that's Deborah going to work . 
_d3161 		aboard the wedding ship Scuttle saw Vanessa's reflection in the mirror and realized it was really Ursula . 
_d3161 		Scuttle and the other seagulls did their best to interrupt the wedding by flying at Vanessa . 
_d3161 		um . 
_d3161 		this is one the ship . 
_d3161 		um that looks like a little flower or something and this is some smoke maybe ? 

_d3161 		I'll call her back . 
_d3161 		um you can talk said prince you're the one it was you all the time . 
_d3161 		happy at last the prince leaned over to kiss Ariel but seconds before the kiss the sun set . 
_d3161 		you're too late shouted Ursula Ariel looked down and saw that her legs had changed back into a tail . 
_d3161 		it's not you I'm after said Ursula I've got bigger fish to fry . 
_d3161 		and at those words king Tritan appeared . 
_d3161 		in return for his daughter's freedom the king agreed to take Ariel's place as Ursula's slave . 
_d3161 		at last this is mine Ursula cried placing +...
_d3161 
_d3161 		right that's her +//.
_d3161 
_d3161 		that's Ariel's daddy's crown and his tritan . 
_d3161 		and the bough of the ship pierced her cold heart slowly the horrible sea witch sank beneath the waves forever . 
_d3161 		king Tritan's powers were restored and he realized how happy Eric and Ariel were . 
_d3161 		with his tritan he changed Ariel's tail back into legs . 
_d3161 		mmmm . 

_d3161 		you do like to read . 
_d3161 		uh her father Maurice was busy working on a new invention you'll win first prize at the fair tomorrow Belle predicted . 

_d3161 		Maurice approached the castle and stepped inside . 
_d3161 		say you'll marry me he said but Belle refused there was no way she'd marry that conceited bully . 
_d3161 		Gaston left angrily . 
_d3161 		just then Philippe arrived with no rider where's papa ? 
_d3161 		you must take me to him +//.
_d3161 
_d3161 		I don't suppose she's French so maybe she just said where's papa huh . 
_d3161 		Belle rode through the forest braving the thick fog and frightening sounds when she found the castle . 
_d3161 		I'm the master of this castle roared the beast +/.
_d3161 
_d3161 		that's right . 
_d3161 		take me instead of my father said Belle . 
_d3161 		and the beast agreed there's the beast .

_d3161 		there he is .
_d3161 
_d3161 		you can go anywhere you like he said to Belle except the west wing and you will join me for dinner . 
_d3161 		she'll always see me as a monster grumbled the beast . 
_d3161 		but one day at dinner the beast remembered his manners and later he and Belle shared a wonderful dance . 
_d3161 		the beast asked Belle if she was happy . 
_d3161 		oh yes said Belle if only I could see my father . 
_d3161 		so the beast brought Belle a magic mirror and her father appeared in it . 
_d3161 		but he was wondering lost in the forest you must go to him said the beast sadly but take the mirror so you can remember me . 
_d3161 		she left the castle and found her father and brought him home . 
_d3161 		but suddenly Gaston arrived with an angry crowd your father's crazy he think thinks he's seen a beast . 
_d3161 		but Belle had to convince everyone her father was not crazy so she picked up the magic mirror and showed the beast to the crowd . 
_d3161 		Gaston locked Belle and her father in the cellar and set off to find the beast .
_d3161 
_d3161 		she's in her house . 
_d3161 		Belle and her father escaped from the cellar and also began riding towards the castle . 
_d3161 		when Belle and her father arrived the beast had Gaston by the throat . 
_d3161 		let me go cried Gaston and the beast felt sorry for him and released him . 
_d3161 		that's right they are wearing capes . 
_d3161 		uh  right .
_d3161 
_d3161 		hmmm . 
_d3161 		as the beast embraced Belle Gaston stabbed him in the back and the beast let out a terrible roar . 
_d3161 		Gaston tripped and fell off the balcony and was never to be seen again . 
_d3161 		the beast collapsed in Belle's arms you came back he said at least I got_to see you one more time . 
_d3161 		Belle began to cry . 
_d3161 		oh no please said Belle I love you . 
_d3161 		and at Belle's words the beast  became human again . 
_d3161 		it's me he said to Belle and all the household servants became human too . 

_d3170 
_d3170 		they're  , they're  turning colors .
_d3170 
_d3170 		well the thing about the commercial thing is that they use more (.)  (.) they give you more   of installing it .
_d3170 
_d3170 		oh .
_d3170 
_d3171 		hmmm . 

_d3172 		strawberries . 
_d3172 		the purple crayon book ?
_d3172 
_d3173 		yes . 
_d3173 		one evening after thinking it over for some time , Harold decided to go for a walk in the moonlight . 
_d3173 		there wasn't any moon , and Harold needed a moon for a walk in the moonlight . 
_d3173 		and he needed something to walk on . 
_d3173 		he made a long straight path so he wouldn't get lost . 
_d3173 		and he set off on his walk taking his big purple crayon with him . 
_d3173 		but he didn't seem to be getting anywhere on the long straight path , so he left the path for a shortcut across a field . 
_d3173 		and the moon went with him . 
_d3173 		the shortcut led right to where Harold thought a forest ought_to be . 
_d3173 		he didn't want to get lost in the woods so he made a very small forest . 
_d3173 		how many trees are in this forest ? 
_d3173 		yeah , just one tree ? 
_d3173 		yeah , just one .
_d3173 
_d3173 		it turned out to be an apple tree . 
_d3173 		the apples would be very tasty when they got red , Howard thought . 
_d3173 		uh , o:h . 
_d3173 		he put a frightening dragon under the tree to guard the apples .
_d3173 
_d3173 		he is going to scare Harold .
_d3173 
_d3173 		it was a terribly frightening dragon .
_d3173 
_d3174 		it frightened Harold , and he backed away . 
_d3174 		his hand holding the purple crayon shook . 
_d3174 		suddenly , he realized what was happening , but by then , Harold was over his head in an ocean . 
_d3174 		he drew water . 
_d3174 		but he came up thinking fast , and in no time he was climbing aboard a trim little boat . 
_d3174 		he quickly set sail . 
_d3174 		ooh boy , that's annoying , huh ? 
_d3174 		op , it's gone . 
_d3174 		I think it was a car alarm . 
_d3174 		whadda [: what do] you think ? 
_d3174 		it was a car ?
_d3174 
_d3174 		yeah , I think so .
_d3174 
_d3174 		he quickly set sail , and the moon sailed with him . 
_d3174 		after he had sailed long enough , Harold made land without too much trouble . 
_d3174 		he stepped ashore on the beach wondering where he was . 
_d3174 		the sandy beach reminded Harold of picnics , and the thought of picnics made him hungry . 
_d3174 		so he laid out a nice simple picnic lunch . 
_d3174 		there was nothing but +... 
_d3174 		pie .
_d3174 
_d3174 		but there were all nine kinds of pie that Harold liked best . 
_d3174 		when harold finished his picnic there was quite a lot left . 
_d3174 		he hated to see so much delicious pie go to waste . 
_d3174 		so he left a very hungry +... 
_d3174 		moose , and a deserving +...
_d3174

_d3208 		and went to get a drink of water . 
_d3208 		he wondered about the things people see in the dark and where they came from . 
_d3208 		he was glad he couldn't see them in the moonlight . 
_d3208 		suddenly he realized he didn't see anything at all in the moonlight , there was nothing to see . 
_d3208 		he was in the middle of a desert . 
_d3208 		no wonder he was so thirsty . 
_d3208 		but luckily he had brought his purple crayon , and he knew where to find water on the desert . 
_d3208 		there was always a pool of it somewhere near a palm tree . 
_d3208 		Harold drank deeply . 
_d3208 		there's [: there is] nothing like drinking nice cool water on a desert . 
_d3208 		but there isn't much else to do on a desert +... 
_d3208 		Harold realized as he looked around , except maybe play in the sand . 
_d3208 		then he remembered how the  +//. 
_d3208 		then he remembered how the government has fun on the desert . 
_d3208 		it shoots off rockets . 
_d3208 		nineteen+fifty+six book . 
_d3208 		Harold decided to go to the moon . 
_d3208 		on a good fast rocket he figured he could get there and back in time for breakfast . 
_d3208 		he fired the rocket and off he went . 
_d3208 		xxx but the rocket missed the moon . 
_d3208 		it missed it by a mile ! 
_d3208 		and Harold went up and up +... 
_d3208 		up and +/.
_d3208 
_d3208 		there's the moon !
_d3208 
_d3208 		but he was going up up up in the dark . 
_d3208 		where's he gonna land ? 
_d3208 		he tried to see where he was going by looking at the stars . 
_d3208 		he tried planets and comets , what he really needed to light his way was another moon . 
_d3208 		when Harold looked closely what he saw wasn't a moon , it was a flying saucer . 
_d3208 		Harold had heard about flying saucers , people saw them in the dark +... 
_d3208 		(a)n(d) nobody knew who was inside flying them . 
_d3208 		he decided he'd [: he had] better land his rocket right away . 
_d3208 		and landed it with a bump on the bottom of a strange planet . 
_d3208 		there was no danger falling off so big a planet +... 
_d3208 		however Harold thought he would feel a little bit more comfortable at the top of the planet . 
_d3208 		he wondered what planet he was on . 
_d3208 		in the dark light of the stars he looked for some sign that might tell him . 
_d3208 		xxx what planet is he on ? 
_d3208 		is he on Jupiter ? 
_d3208 		he's on Mars .
_d3208 
_d3208 		Harold had heard of men on Mars so he yelled a couple of hellos hopefully . 
_d3208 		he thought of the flying saucer out there and thought of the things that people see in the dark . 
_d3208 		he felt a great need for some company . 
_d3208 		he was sure any man on Mars would be cordial to a visitor like Harold who had come all this way to chat with him . 
_d3208 		he had to draw on his scanty knowledge of what a man on Mars looked like . 
_d3208 		but his looks wouldn't really matter in the dark so Harold didn't care much what he turned out to look like . 
_d3208 		all Harold wanted to know was there was some sort of friendly face close by . 
_d3208 		then all of a sudden Harold did see it clearly +... 
_d3208 		it was the face of a thing . 
_d3208 		it was a thing people see in the dark and it was sitting on a flying saucer . 
_d3208 		and Harold ran away . 
_d3208 		and he thought and stopped . 
_d3208 		probably the thing was about to fly to Earth and scare somebody maybe a little child . 
_d3208 		so bravely Harold crept back . 
_d3208 		he approached on tiptoe so the thing wouldn't hear him . 
_d3208 		and he reached out with his purple crayon +... 
_d3208 		and he put a completely damaging crack in the flying saucer . 
_d3208 		xxx . 
_d3208 		before the thing could grab him he was off again chuckling triumphantly . 
_d3208 		and ran as fast as he could in the dark . 
_d3208 		happily most of the way was downhill . 
_d3208 		he hoped he wouldn't fall head over heels . 
_d3208 		he arrived safely heels over head at the bottom of Mars where the rocket was . 
_d3208 		but by this time Harold had had enough of adventure , he wanted to get home in a dependable way . 
_d3208 		so he climbed down on the stars . 
_d3208 		it was sure but it was slow . 
_d3208 		and the points of the stars hurt Harold's feet . 
_d3208 		Harold wished he were home . 
_d3208 		and he recalled the best way to wish on a +//. 
_d3208 		is on a good big shooting star .
_d3208 
_d3208 		instead of wishing it occurred to him at the last moment to jump aboard . 
_d3208 		he shot right down to +//. 
_d3208 		what planet does Harold live on ?
_d3208 
_d3208 		well he was visiting Mars but what planet do we live on ? 
_d3208 		Earth right !
_d3208 
_d3208 		he shot right down to Earth where he made a neat two+point landing . 
_d3208 		he hadn't passed the moon on the way and he wondered what happened to it , it wasn't anywhere around . 
_d3208 		then he realized the night was just about gone and it was time for the sun to come up . 
_d3208 		he was very hungry . 
_d3208 		the sun appeared right on time . 
_d3208 		it came up big and bright +... 
_d3208 		and Harold remarked it was going to be a very nice day . 
_d3208 		nobody was even bothered by flying saucers and things in the sunshine . 
_d3208 		but for a startled moment he thought he saw a flying saucer . 
_d3208 		it was on the horizon looking as if it had just come in to land . 
_d3208 		he was mistaken though it wasn't a saucer it was an oatmeal bowl . 
_d3208 		xxx Harold happened to like hot breakfasts and he quickly drew up a chair . 
_d3208 		and sat down to +...

_d3208 
_d3208 		but I'll read it anyway . 
_d3208 		the abridged version . 
_d3208 		Laney Lamb and Lily Bunny were best friends . 
_d3208 		everyday they met in the wildflower meadow just as the warm spring sun first sparkled on the morning dew . 
_d3208 		hooray squealed Lily she hopped even higher than before did a somersault and landed gracefully in the soft spring grass . 
_d3208 		awesome cried a strange deep voice . 
_d3208 		there was a bright green frog . 
_d3208 		that was excellent he croaked . 
_d3208 		oh hello Fritz said Laney . 
_d3208 		hi said Fritz the frog I hope I'm not interrupting you . 
_d3208 		this is my friend Lily Bunny Laney said . 
_d3208 		oh nice to meet you Fritz croaked . 
_d3208 		but Lily just nodded at Fritz and looked away . 
_d3208 		she didn't like the thought of sharing the meadow and her friend with a stranger . 
_d3208 		Lily scowled she wanted Laney to pay attention to her . 
_d3208 		but Laney was so busy performing for Fritz she didn't hear . 
_d3208 		all that morning Laney played with Fritz while Lily stayed by herself at the far end of the me(adow) meadow . 
_d3208 		come on Lily , Laney bleated Fritz is picking watercress for us and it's [: it is] delicious . 
_d3208 		Lily stamped one of her big back feet and glared angrily at Laney . 
_d3208 		look she said you can play with that frog all you want but if you're going to be friends with him you can't be friends with me . 
_d3208 		why said Laney feeling very sad and confused . 
_d3208 		because said Laney that's [: that is] just the way it is . 
_d3208 		the next morning Lily didn't go to the wildflower meadow but went to have breakfast on the other side of the grassy hill . 
_d3208 		and there she met Penelope Pig . 
_d3208 		well here's [: here is] a surprise I thought you'd [: you would] be with Laney . 
_d3208 		you're best friends aren't you ? 
_d3208 		we were but now she wants to play with some frog . 
_d3208 		well maybe I can help said Penelope I know a lot about friends and friendship . 

_d3208 
_d3208 		she is big . 
_d3208 		it's perfectly fine to have more than one good friend at a time . 
_d3208 		friendship is the perfect thing to share and having more friends mean having more fun . 
_d3208 		Penelope walked away leaving Lily alone . 
_d3208 		Penelope thinks she's so smart Lily thought but she doesn't understand . 
_d3208 		Lily started to eat but the plants were not as sweet as the ones by the pond . 
_d3208 		and she heard the laughter and shouting of two voices . 
_d3208 		she saw Laney and Fritz picking flowers together . 
_d3208 		they've got some nerve she said making all that racket . 
_d3208 		whatever they're [: they are] doing they're certainly having fun they don't need my help and that's fine with me . 
_d3208 		that afternoon Lily was sulking in the shade of a tree and Fritz hurried up and called Lily come quick Laney wants you right away . 
_d3208 		what does she want Lily asked coldly but Fritz had already hurried back over the hill . 
_d3208 		huh , it's probably nothing but I'll still go and see she said . 
_d3208 		when she got there she found Laney and Fritz proudly displaying a beautiful Lily sized necklace . 
_d3208 		how do you like it said Laney . 
_d3208 		is it for me she said . 
_d3208 		we made it just for you said Laney because you're my very best friend . 
_d3208 		and because I'd like to be your friend too Fritz said . 
_d3208 		oh what a beautiful necklace she said I've been so selfish . 
_d3208 		that's okay Laney said we didn't mean to leave you out I just got so excited about having a new friend that I forgot about our game . 
_d3208 		I was selfish too . 
_d3208 		well I'm sorry said Lily I hope it's not too late for us to have some fun together . 
_d3208 		so for the rest of the day the three friends romped and frolicked in the meadow . 
_d3208 		I'm glad to see Lily and Laney are friends again Penelope said . 
_d3208 		it was my advice that got them back together you know . 
_d3208 		early the next morning Lily Laney and Fritz met by the pond and all three had great fun together . 

_d3277 		I'm going to help with our wash .

_d3277 		you don't want your precious things to get all wet and soapy . 
_d3277 		pockets , said Corduroy to himself . 
_d3277 		I don't have a pocket .
_d3277 
_d3277 		he slid off the chair . 
_d3277 		I must go find something to make a pocket out of , he said , and he began to look around .
_d3277 
_d3277 		first he came to a pile of fancy towels and wash+cloths , but nothing was the right size or color . 
_d3277 		then he saw a huge stack of colorful clothes in a laundry basket . 
_d3277 		there ought_to be something in there to make a pocket out of , he said . 
_d3277 		without hesitating , he climbed inside the bag , which was filled with pieces of wet laundry . 
_d3277 		the dampness didn't bother Corduroy in the least . 
_d3277 		this must be a ca:ve , he said , sighing happily . 
_d3277 		I've always wanted to live in a dark , cool cave .
_d3277 
_d3277 		when the time came for Lisa to fetch her bear , he was gone ! 
_d3277 		oh Mommy , she said , Corduroy isn't here where I left him ! 
_d3277 		I'm sorry , Honey , said her mother , but the Laundromat will be closing soon and we must be getting home . 
_d3277 		Lisa was reluctant to leave without Corduroy , but her mother insisted . 
_d3277 		you can come back tomorrow , she said . 
_d3277 		I'm sure he will still be here .
_d3277 
_d3277 		before he knew it , Corduroy was being tossed together with all the sheets and shirts and shorts and slacks +... 
_d3277 		into the dryer .
_d3277 
_d3277 		but just as the artist was shutting the glass door , Corduroy tumbled out onto the floor . 
_d3277 		how in thunder did that bear ever get mixed up with my things , the artist wondered . 
_d3277 		poor Corduroy was damp all over . 
_d3277 		the least I can do for him is give his overalls a good drying , said the man thoughtfully . 
_d3277 		Corduroy grew dizzy as he watched the clothes spinning round , but the artist became inspired . 
_d3277 		this would make a wonderful painting , he said as he took out his sketch+pad and began drawing the swirling colors . 
_d3277 		I can hardly wait to get back to my studio . 
_d3277 		finally , the dryer stopped whirling and the man gathered up the clothes . 
_d3277 		and he helped Corduroy put on his warm , dry overalls . 
_d3277 		all at once , the manager of the laundromat called , closing time , everybody out . 
_d3277 		Corduroy was gently placed on top of a washing machine . 
_d3277 		I wonder who that bear belongs to , said the artist as he was leaving . 
_d3277 		it seems to me he should have his name someplace . 

_d3277 		maybe it's snow , he said . 
_d3277 		I've always wanted to play in the snow .
_d3277 
_d3277 		he accidentally tipped over the open+lidded box and suddenly he was covered in soft , slippery soap flakes .
_d3277 		it's soap ! 
_d3277 		gradually , Corduroy began to slip and slide . 
_d3277 		what fun , he said with a smile ! 
_d3277 		I've always wanted to ski down a steep mountainside .
_d3277 
_d3277 		he landed paws first in an empty laundry basket . 
_d3277 		this must be a cage , he said . 
_d3277 		I've never wanted to live inside a cage . 
