_t4 		it's like a blender .

_t4 		it's shaped like that . 
_t4 		it's Arthur's turn to cook ? 
_t4 		oh , not his mommy's turn ? 
_t4 		should I keep reading the book ? 
_t4 		that's Mrs Tibble . 
_t4 		later that afternoon Arthur and d+w took Kate for a walk . 
_t4 		look shouted the Tibble twins , there's d+w . 
_t4 		oh no said d+w .

_t4 		yes , the dishwasher is making noise . 
_t4 		I'm in a terrible pickle she said .

_t4 		today is March  eighteenth . 
_t4 		eighteenth .
_t4 		can you say eighteenth ? 
_t4 		March eighteenth , that's hard to say I would imagine . 
_t4 		Naima is very into taking off her backpack . 
_t4 		so: .
_t4 		March eighteenth . 
_t4 		can you say that ?
_t4 		can you say March eighteenth ? 
_t4 		is that funny ? 
_t4 		you have one sleeve off and one sleeve on . 
_t4 		you have a naked arm and an arm with a shirt on it . 
_t4 		an arm with a glirt on it . 
_t4 		we've been adding consonant clusters to the beginning of words that aren't the ones that belong there just for fun and especially in a swearing manner . 
_t4 		one sleeve on and one sleeve off . 
_t4 		you wanna put the other one on ? 
_t4 		do you want me to help ? 
_t4 		this is what we need to do .

_t4 		he's taking his baby brother for a walk in a stroller . 
_t4 		oh yeah , we saw  and  in Provincetown yesterday . 
_t4 		that wasn't  house though , they were just staying there . 
_t4 		that was a vacation house . 
_t4 		you know when we went to Maine we stayed at a vacation house . 
_t4 		they were at a vacation house also . 
_t4 		xxx and  and  .

_t4 		what kind of toys did he have ? 
_t4 		what did he have_to play with ? 
_t4 		yes , he had a tennis ball . 
_t4 		you're right Naima . 
_t4 		he did have a regular ball also . 
_t4 		yeah , I guess you're right . 
_t4 		and he had that funny , long red toy . 
_t4 		um , I'm trying to remember what  said it was called . 
_t4 		I think she said it was a ,  . 
_t4 		something like a grab it . 
_t4 		I think she throws the ball with that toy . 
_t4 		you know  birthday is next week .

_t4 		oh they're going to go to  house ? 
_t4 		to her vacation house ? 
_t4 		oh . 
_t4 		are you being careful there ? 
_t4 		yeah , okay . 
_t4 		hi koala+mala . 
_t4 		how come you stopped calling the koala koala+mala ? 
_t4 		you're just calling the koala Koala these days . 
_t4 		right ? 
_t4 		Arthur . 
_t4 		he is , now let's see . 
_t4 		what's he doing in this picture ? 
_t4 		do you wanna sit down here and read it with me ? 
_t4 		sit down . 
_t4 		sit down right here . 
_t4 		we'll read the book together . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		babysitting is such a big responsibility , said Arthur . 
_t4 		he's talking to his sister whose name is d+w . 
_t4 		she has a helmet in her hands . 
_t4 		I'm a little nervous , said Arthur . 
_t4 		he said I'm a little nervous . 
_t4 		you'll do a fine job .
_t4 		that's his little ,  , brother or sister . 
_t4 		we'll be right here if you want to call us said Father . 
_t4 		here's my crash helmet , said d+w . 
_t4 		you'll need it . 
_t4 		why ? 
_t4 		asked Arthur . 
_t4 		are you coming along ? 
_t4 		you think I'm trouble said d+w . 
_t4 		just wait . 
_t4 		they're eating pizza , look . 
_t4 		look at this . 
_t4 		come here and look this picture . 
_t4 		what's that ? 
_t4 		it's a special kind of a box for what ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 		it's a special kind of a box for pizza . 
_t4 		what else are they eating , what's that ? 
_t4 		is that a salad ? 
_t4 		what are they drinking ? 
_t4 		what's in that ? 
_t4 		that's his Daddy .
_t4 		that's Arthur's Daddy . 
_t4 		yup [: yes] . 
_t4 		hi Sleepy Bear . 
_t4 		Mommy e+f+g ? 
_t4 		whose full name is Mommy e+f+g ? 
_t4 		that's his full name ? 
_t4 		that's a funny name . 
_t4 		hi Sleepy Bear . 
_t4 		oh that's the macaque puppet . 
_t4 		hi macaque puppet . 
_t4 		he's got a very nice tail .
_t4 		hi macaque . 
_t4 		where'd [: where did] his tail go ? 
_t4 		it's right there . 
_t4 		tail ! 
_t4 		macaque has a tail . 
_t4 		it's right there . 
_t4 		where did it go ? 
_t4 		it's right there .
_t4 		it's right there .
_t4 		yes the elephant has a small tail . 
_t4 		the macaque has a +... 
_t4 		big tail . 
_t4 		and you could you also say +... 
_t4 		the macaque has a long tail . 
_t4 		and the elephant has a short tail . 
_t4 		a short tail . 
_t4 		is that a lion or a duck ? 
_t4 		I know that what I said it was .
_t4 		but look at its feet . 
_t4 		I think it's a duck , Naima . 
_t4 		I think it's a duck+lion . 
_t4 		could we call it +... 
_t4 		could we call it Lionel ? 
_t4 		Lionel . 
_t4 		or do you wanna give the duck a different name ? 
_t4 		Koalaba ? 
_t4 		I think I'll rewind this a bit to double check it   . 
_t4 		where'd [: where did] it go ? 
_t4 		where did the macaque tail go ? 
_t4 		oh let's see . 
_t4 		that's a pretty good view of the couch . 
_t4 		it's time to read .
_t4 		where's +...
_t4 		what +...
_t4 		Arthur . 
_t4 		let's read over here for a little bit . 
_t4 		did I say what the date is ? 
_t4 		it's +...
_t4 		March , March eighteenth .
_t4 		March eighteenth . 
_t4 		wanna look at the Yoka book ? 
_t4 		come sit up here and read . 
_t4 		oh sorry . 
_t4 		are you okay ? 
_t4 		do you want me to get the Arthur book and bring it over here ? 
_t4 		we'll look at that book . 
_t4 		come sit next to Mommy . 
_t4 		come sit here and we'll read it together . 
_t4 		Sleepy Bear's [: Bear is] gonna sit right there , okay . 
_t4 		you wanna sit right next to me ? 
_t4 		put your bottom right over here . 
_t4 		how about like this . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		very good . 
_t4 		Arthur . 
_t4 		what is this on your pants by the way ? 
_t4 		fuzz .
_t4 		you had fuzz on your pants . 
_t4 		okay , what's going on here ? 
_t4 		let's see . 
_t4 		oh+my+goodness , is Arthur gonna baby+sit ? 
_t4 		that means he's gonna take care of those children . 
_t4 		Arthur is here walking past his friends . 
_t4 		he's telling them I'm going to take care of those twins . 
_t4 		who is that ? 
_t4 		what kind of ears does that animal have ? 
_t4 		what kind of animal is that ? 
_t4 		is it a rabbit ? 
_t4 		oh , let's see what's happening in this picture . 
_t4 		oh+my+goodness . 
_t4 		that baby's diaper is leaking . 
_t4 		you can see the drops of pee+pee coming out of the diaper . 
_t4 		and Arthur is +... 
_t4 		Arthur's pants got all wet . 
_t4 		yeah , I think that baby's diaper is leaking . 
_t4 		he needs a new diaper . 
_t4 		I think the baby is crying . 
_t4 		and that's d+w . 
_t4 		she's crying in that picture . 
_t4 		and what's happening in that picture ? 
_t4 		that baby's [: baby is] throwing up . 
_t4 		remember , you threw up when you were sick . 
_t4 		I think she is sick . 
_t4 		she's throwing up some green stuff that came out of her tummy . 
_t4 		that's what happened to you when you were sick . 
_t4 		you were throwing up also . 
_t4 		yeah , sometimes it was orange . 
_t4 		that's what the baby's [: baby is] throwing up . 
_t4 		(be)cause she's sick she needs to have some medicine maybe . 
_t4 		and here's a picture of Arthur and his sister d+w . 
_t4 		she's jumping on the sofa . 
_t4 		Arthur's [: Arthur is] trying to read a book . 
_t4 		his sister's [: sister is] making a lot of noise . 
_t4 		that's Mrs Tibble . 
_t4 		she has to go out . 
_t4 		xxx  . 
_t4 		the cat looks like she's hiding . 
_t4 		yup [: yes] , she might +... 
_t4 		well d+w's not in this picture . 
_t4 		there's d+w . 
_t4 		okay you wanna look at this page . 
_t4 		d+w's [: d+w is] jumping on the sofa . 
_t4 		that's Arthur who's holding the crying baby . 
_t4 		that's his sister I think . 
_t4 		oh she's having pee+pee come out of her diaper . 
_t4 		it's leaking . 
_t4 		she needs her diaper changed . 
_t4 		Arthur has to change her now . 
_t4 		she's throwing up . 
_t4 		that's Arthur .
_t4 		he's saying  . 
_t4 		let's see what happens next . 
_t4 		yes , Arthur is holding the throwing up baby . 
_t4 		Arthur's holding the baby who is throwing up . 
_t4 		I think maybe he's trying to help her feel better . 
_t4 		hmmm , I wonder where Daddy is . 
_t4 		he was supposed to come home . 
_t4 		maybe he's reading his paper at work . 
_t4 		that's d+w . 
_t4 		she's crying . 
_t4 		her overalls ? 
_t4 		she's wearing a dress that looks like overalls .
_t4 		what is she doing ? 
_t4 		she's laughing . 
_t4 		there's all of Arthur's friends . 
_t4 		are you saying to Mommy to read some ? 
_t4 		Arthur remembered what that was like . 
_t4 		now he was really worried .
_t4 		there I read it . 
_t4 		I think that that +... 
_t4 		can you read the letters there on that book that d+w was reading ? 
_t4 		what letters are those ? 
_t4 		can you see them ? 
_t4 		oh you wanna talk about that picture with the babies throwing up ? 
_t4 		do you think Arthur might give her some medicine to help her feel better ? 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		there he is . 
_t4 		he's her big brother . 
_t4 		do you want me to talk about that picture ? 
_t4 		that's the picture where the baby's diaper is leaking and Arthur's pants are getting wet . 
_t4 		see how the pants are dark on his thighs ? 
_t4 		that means the baby's diaper leaked . 
_t4 		the baby's diaper leaked and made Arthur's pants all wet . 
_t4 		I think he probably will get another diaper for that baby . 
_t4 		and he will probably also change his pants . 
_t4 		what thing away ? 
_t4 		those green things are the throw up that is coming out of the baby's mouth . 
_t4 		oh , you think he'll clean it up ? 
_t4 		yeah you're right . 
_t4 		he'll probably clean it up +... 
_t4 		he'll probably get a wet rag and clean it off of this chair . 
_t4 		clean the green throw up off of the chair . 
_t4 		and then put the rag in the laundry or throw it away . 
_t4 		I think he will because he's the one who's taking care of the baby . 
_t4 		when you're taking care of someone who's sick you do that kind of thing . 
_t4 		you clean up the throw up and stuff like that . 
_t4 		she is throwing up . 
_t4 		I bet she doesn't feel good . 
_t4 		she probably feels lousy . 
_t4 		I'm so glad you're better though Naima . 
_t4 		what happened with the nurses ? 
_t4 		in the hospital ? 
_t4 		they did a lot of things to take care of you . 
_t4 		well +... 
_t4 		they put a special bangle on your arm which had blue tape on it . 
_t4 		and they connected a hose to your hand . 
_t4 		so that you could get the medicine that you needed . 
_t4 		they checked to make sure you had enough medicine . 
_t4 		well , they took your temperature +... 
_t4 		by sticking that thermometer in your ear . 
_t4 		they took your temperature . 
_t4 		they listened to your chest with a stethoscope . 
_t4 		one of the nurses gave you a grizzly+bear . 
_t4 		it was Janet who gave you the grizzly+bear . 
_t4 		I think Barbara did take off the blue bangle . 
_t4 		which was like a bandage . 
_t4 		she took off the blue sticky tape that was on your arm . 
_t4 		she took out the needle . 
_t4 		there was a needle . 
_t4 		she took it all off . 
_t4 		oh and you had a bangle on your ankle also . 
_t4 		that's right and she took that off . 
_t4 		I think that had your name on it . 
_t4 		you had that bangle on your ankle too . 
_t4 		I forgot that . 
_t4 		and you had some kind of a special night+gown . 
_t4 		what was it ? 
_t4 		what was on it ? 
_t4 		was it bears ? 
_t4 		what was on the night+gown ? 
_t4 		uh .
_t4 		I think maybe it was little bears . 
_t4 		little pink bears ? 
_t4 		and +...
_t4 		mmmm +...
_t4 		oh you're right it was elephants . 
_t4 		you had the special elephant night+gown when you were at the hospital . 
_t4 		and there was a special crib there . 
_t4 		do you remember that crib ? 
_t4 		and Mommy slept next to you . 
_t4 		on that chair . 
_t4 		next to your crib , right ? 
_t4 		and Mommy nursed you too , to help you feel better . 
_t4 		remember ? 
_t4 		you were sick , yeah . 
_t4 		well ,  +...
_t4 		the book fell down that was on my lap . 
_t4 		the nurses brought food for Mommy to eat . 
_t4 		they took away your diapers after I changed you and they weighed them . 
_t4 		on a scale . 
_t4 		a scale is for finding out how heavy something is . 
_t4 		it measures how heavy something is . 
_t4 		we weighed Naima too . 
_t4 		we weighed you . 
_t4 		you weighed twenty+five pounds . 
_t4 		again ?
_t4 		we already talked about it . 
_t4 		who's throwing up ? 
_t4 		mmmm , who is the baby's brother ? 
_t4 		Arthur ? 
_t4 		can we +... 
_t4 		you wanna turn the page and see what else happens in this story ? 
_t4 		oh okay , we already saw this page . 
_t4 		there's a cat . 
_t4 		there's the two little kids . 
_t4 		he's gonna take care of them for a while . 
_t4 		oh+my+goodness , it looks like they're playing with cards . 
_t4 		he's jumping . 
_t4 		that's Arthur .
_t4 		he's saying , I'll be the sheriff . 
_t4 		ooh , Mommy's [: Mommy has] got quite a stomach+ache .
_t4 		I think we're gonna stop taping . 
_t4 		it's my tummy that hurts . 
_t4 		wanna kiss my tummy ? 
_t4 		very nice . 
_t4 		almost all better . 
_t4 		I am sick . 
_t4 		I'm better since you've kissed my belly . 
_t4 		are you upside down ? 
_t4 		this is two days after  . 
_t4 		uh . 
_t4 		so today is March twentieth . 
_t4 		oh you brought your lego elephant into the kitchen . 
_t4 		and a lego penguin . 
_t4 		can I put this on you please ? 
_t4 		who's driving that ? 
_t4 		who's driving the +..? 
_t4 		what would you call that ? 
_t4 		is that the zoo vehicle ? 
_t4 		it looks like a zoo+keeper . 
_t4 		hi zoo+keeper . 
_t4 		oh it's a zoo vehicle . 
_t4 		is that what Grandma called it ? 
_t4 		yeah , it looks like a good zoo vehicle . 
_t4 		like you could carry an animal in the back of it . 
_t4 		are you going to put an animal in there ? 
_t4 		an elephant perhaps ? 
_t4 		where's it gonna go ? 
_t4 		oh and it has a , it has a little +... 
_t4 		it can walk up the back of it like a ramp . 
_t4 		that's like a ramp they can walk into it . 
_t4 		and sit on the side . 
_t4 		that's nice . 
_t4 		does that zoo+keeper have the word zoo on his shirt ? 
_t4 		z o o ? 
_t4 		I think so . 
_t4 		z o o ? 
_t4 		spells zoo , right ? 
_t4 		did Grandma tell you that ? 
_t4 		let's spell zoo . 
_t4 		zoo . 
_t4 		are they wearing shirts ? 
_t4 		since they're elephants do their shirts say penguin and elephant ? 
_t4 		are you gonna give some breakfast to your zoo animals ? 
_t4 		do you think they want breakfast ? 
_t4 		what ? 
_t4 		they want fish ? 
_t4 		oh , I know where the fish are . 
_t4 		do you know where the fish are ? 
_t4 		I'm gonna +...
_t4 		I'll bring you some fish to give them . 
_t4 		stay there I'll get them for you .

_t4 		well , I can call and just mention it to them at least . 
_t4 		so that it doesn't go completely  +... 
_t4 		you know . 
_t4 		looks like you're outta [: out of] food there . 
_t4 		do you want something else to eat Naima ? 
_t4 		whatd'ya [: what do you] think ? 
_t4 		I don't think that we're out of it , but I do think that you could have something else . 
_t4 		like +... 
_t4 		raisins . 
_t4 		or what else ? 
_t4 		is that what it feels like ? 
_t4 		your hair was a little outta [: out of] control there . 
_t4 		how (a)bout some bread with +..? 
_t4 		oh how (a)bout some bear food Naima ? 
_t4 		are you a bear+cub that wants to eat bear food ? 
_t4 		or you could have some egg yolk . 
_t4 		I'm the mommy bear . 
_t4 		and you're the baby bear . 
_t4 		pappa bear . 
_t4 		I need to tell you that while you're eating ? 
_t4 		what are you gonna eat ? 
_t4 		you're gonna have some fresh grated apple ? 
_t4 		does that sound good ? 
_t4 		I can do that but what are you gonna eat while I'm telling it to you ? 
_t4 		I will tell it to you but you've got_to be eating something . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		it's a deal egg yolk and egg white . 
_t4 		yes ! 
_t4 		good idea Naima . 
_t4 		first I'm gonna take the shell off of the egg . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm .
_t4 		(be)cause we don't eat the shell with the eggs . 
_t4 		how do you spell egg ? 
_t4 		it does have a g in it . 
_t4 		egg is spelled +... 
_t4 		e g g . 
_t4 		this shell does not want to come off this egg . 
_t4 		it's difficult , and Mommy's [: Mommy is] having a tough time with this egg . 
_t4 		you think Daddy will do it if Mommy can't do it ? 
_t4 		hmmm +... 
_t4 		while I'm doing it it's just a +... 
_t4 		I didn't cook the egg properly . 
_t4 		that's why the shell is sticking to the egg . 
_t4 		like tape . 
_t4 		yes tape sticks to photographs sometimes . 
_t4 		especially in the book we made for you called Naima's journeys right ? 
_t4 		is that what you're thinking of ? 
_t4 		all+right let's see here . 
_t4 		let's slice this egg for you . 
_t4 		should we get a plate maybe ? 
_t4 		what color plate's [: plate is] that ? 
_t4 		here's some egg white . 
_t4 		here's some egg yolk . 
_t4 		mmmm , big chunks of egg yolk . 
_t4 		they look like chunks of cheese . 
_t4 		go (a)head and eat some and I'll tell you the story of Goldilocks . 
_t4 		once upon a time there was a little girl who went on a walk in the +... 
_t4 		forest . 
_t4 		she saw a snake ? 
_t4 		you like that variation don't you ? 
_t4 		she saw a snake +... 
_t4 		she saw a robin . 
_t4 		she saw a badger . 
_t4 		she liked walking in the forest . 
_t4 		so that she could see all the different animals . 
_t4 		she was having fun , but she was walking for a long time . 
_t4 		and then she got tired . 
_t4 		and she , first she found the house . 
_t4 		a house up ahead . 
_t4 		she was hungry and tired . 
_t4 		so first she decided to knock on the door . 
_t4 		knock knock knock . 
_t4 		but there was no answer . 
_t4 		so she walked in the house . 
_t4 		and then what happens next ? 
_t4 		what does she +..?
_t4 		she wants to find the bears ? 
_t4 		what does she see when she walks in the house ? 
_t4 		three chairs yes , three rocking chairs . 
_t4 		a big one . 
_t4 		a medium sized one . 
_t4 		and a little one . 
_t4 		and then +... 
_t4 		she sat in the biggest rocking chair . 
_t4 		and she started to rock and rock [x 
_t4 		but then she stopped . 
_t4 		and she said this rocking chair is too +... 
_t4 		fast . 
_t4 		so she climbed out of that rocking chair . 
_t4 		she got into the next rocking chair and that was the medium sized rocking chair . 
_t4 		and she rocked [x 
_t4 		and she stopped and she said +... 
_t4 		wait a minute , this rocking chair is too what ? 
_t4 		slow . 
_t4 		so what did she do ? 
_t4 		she climbed out of that rocking chair . 
_t4 		and +... 
_t4 		she climbed into the little rocking chair . 
_t4 		and she rocked [x 
_t4 		and she said  , hey . 
_t4 		I like this rocking chair . 
_t4 		it's just right for me . 
_t4 		and then what happens ? 
_t4 		she's rocking in that little rocking chair for a long time right ? 
_t4 		she rock and she rocked [x 
_t4 		until it broke into bits . 
_t4 		right ? 
_t4 		and then what happens ? 
_t4 		she wants to fix it . 
_t4 		well she's a little girl , she doesn't really have access to tools and screws . 
_t4 		and she's in somebody else's house . 
_t4 		she doesn't know where they keep their tools so she can't fix it . 
_t4 		so she goes into the kitchen because she's hungry . 
_t4 		I think you're right Naima . 
_t4 		I'm slicing a bagel . 
_t4 		(be)cause that's what I'm going to eat for breakfast . 
_t4 		a bagel's [: bagel is] like an o isn't it ? 
_t4 		so she goes into the kitchen and she sees +... 
_t4 		xxx what does she see on the table there ? 
_t4 		yes . 
_t4 		three bowls of porridge . 
_t4 		and one of them is big . 
_t4 		and one of them is medium+sized . 
_t4 		and one of them is ? 
_t4 		little .
_t4 		she sits down in front of the big bowl of porridge and she takes a bite of it . 
_t4 		xxx   she says . 
_t4 		oh this porridge is too hot . 
_t4 		she needs to cool it down . 
_t4 		then she goes over to the medium+sized bowl of porridge and she takes a bite  . 
_t4 		she makes a face like this . 
_t4 		then she says , this porridge is too cold . 
_t4 		so she gets down outta [: out of] that chair . 
_t4 		she goes to the littlest bowl of porridge . 
_t4 		she takes the spoon , dips it in the porridge then sticks it in her mouth and takes a bite . 
_t4 		xxx   . 
_t4 		and that porridge was just right ! 
_t4 		that's right Naima you know this story don't you ? 
_t4 		where's Mommy's coffee ? 
_t4 		and +... 
_t4 		and then she keeps eating the little bowl of porridge . 
_t4 		and she eats and eats [x 
_t4 		until what happens ? 
_t4 		she finishes it . 
_t4 		that's right (un)til it's all gone . 
_t4 		and then she wants to wash her bowl off ? 
_t4 		okay , and so then she takes the bowl and she takes it over to the sink . 
_t4 		she puts some soap on it and she uses a sponge . 
_t4 		and she washes off the bowl until it's all clean . 
_t4 		it might've been that she wanted to dry the bowl ? 
_t4 		and cook more porridge what a good idea . 
_t4 		mommy bear ? 
_t4 		is Goldilocks mommy bear ? 
_t4 		I don't think so . 
_t4 		she's in the bears' house though . 
_t4 		she's in the bears' house . 
_t4 		she washes the bowl and she puts it back . 
_t4 		she doesn't cook more porridge I don't think so . 
_t4 		not in this story anyway . 
_t4 		she's tired right ? 
_t4 		so she should find a bed to sleep in . 
_t4 		she goes upstairs and she climbs into the biggest bed that she sees . 
_t4 		and she tries to get comfortable . 
_t4 		and she says  wait a minute this bed is too hard . 
_t4 		she can't get comfy , it's not a comfy bed for her . 
_t4 		and then what happens ? 
_t4 		and then she climbs out of that bed and goes into the medium+sized bed . 
_t4 		she tries to get comfortable . 
_t4 		xxx   . 
_t4 		I can't get comfortable . 
_t4 		she says this bed is too soft it's like sleeping on a big fluffy pillow . 
_t4 		and then she gets out of the medium+sized bed and she goes over to the littlest bed of all . 
_t4 		what happens ? 
_t4 		she's in the littlest bed and she says   this is so comfy . 
_t4 		this bed is just right .
_t4 		and she falls asleep . 
_t4 		the medium+sized bed is the one that's too soft . 
_t4 		the littlest bed the little bed that's right . 
_t4 		the little bed is the one that is very , very comfy . 
_t4 		she falls asleep . 
_t4 		and pretty soon what happens ? 
_t4 		the bears come home to their house . 
_t4 		they walk in the door , they want to rock in their chairs . 
_t4 		they go into the living room and papa bear sits in his chair and he starts to rock . 
_t4 		and he rocks a couple of times and then he stops . 
_t4 		and he says somebody's [: somebody has] been rocking in my chair . 
_t4 		he's very puzzled . 
_t4 		I think you're right . 
_t4 		I think Goldilocks has been rocking in the pappa bear's chair . 
_t4 		and then +... 
_t4 		and the mama bear goes and sits in her chair . 
_t4 		right ? 
_t4 		she starts to rock and what does she say ? 
_t4 		she says , somebody's [: somebody has] been rocking in my chair too . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm I think you're right . 
_t4 		yes Goldilocks is still sleeping upstairs at this point . 
_t4 		and then the baby bear goes over and +... 
_t4 		there's a bird over at the feeder Naima . 
_t4 		birds are coming to eat . 
_t4 		can you see them ? 
_t4 		there's a lot of sun in this room . 
_t4 		there , now you're out of the sun . 
_t4 		can you see the birds ? 
_t4 		oh maybe they'll come back . 
_t4 		you rearranging your cups ? 
_t4 		hey you ate a lot of that egg , good job . 
_t4 		what else would you like to eat ? 
_t4 		sesame ? 
_t4 		okay , let me find the sesame for you . 
_t4 		would you like a pile of sesame right here ? 
_t4 		here's a pile . 
_t4 		well I forgot to buy jam at the store yesterday . 
_t4 		we're almost out of strawberry jam . 
_t4 		what else would you +... 
_t4 		you're eating the sesame , is it good ? 
_t4 		good . 
_t4 		do you wanna eat some apple+sauce Naima ? 
_t4 		I'll get you some apple+sauce . 
_t4 		you want bread and jam ? 
_t4 		you can have some of my bagel . 
_t4 		there's no more jam right now . 
_t4 		do you want apple+sauce too ? 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 		you want some plain bagel ? 
_t4 		I think there's +... 
_t4 		what happened to that ? 
_t4 		uh yeah , you can have some of my plain bagel . 
_t4 		let's see here . 
_t4 		this is Mommy's plain bagel . 
_t4 		oh yeah , the other part of the story  +... 
_t4 		where did we leave off ? 
_t4 		the baby bear looked at his rocking chair . 
_t4 		and it was broken . 
_t4 		and he said someone's [: someone has] been rocking in my rocking chair and they broke it . 
_t4 		ugh he was kinda [: kind of] mad I think . 
_t4 		so then +... 
_t4 		mama bear said , don't worry we'll fix it . 
_t4 		and then where do the bears go ? 
_t4 		into the kitchen . 
_t4 		(be)cause they're hungry . 
_t4 		they've been out walking so they're hungry too just like Goldilocks was . 
_t4 		when you walk for awhile you get hungry . 
_t4 		they've been walking for a long time . 
_t4 		um so the papa bear looked at his bowl , he didn't even have_to take a bite . 
_t4 		he just looked at his bowl and said somebody's [: somebody has] been eating my porridge . 
_t4 		oh no there's an uh+oh here . 
_t4 		yes , I think Goldilocks was the one eating his porridge . 
_t4 		I hope your elbow hasn't been in the way over here . 
_t4 		let's attach this over here . 
_t4 		and then the mama bear also says +... 
_t4 		somebody's [: somebody has] been eating my porridge too ! 
_t4 		I think you're right . 
_t4 		and the baby bear looks at his bowl which is completely clean , remember because she washed it out this time . 
_t4 		and he says somebody's [: somebody has] been eating my porridge . 
_t4 		and she ate it all up . 
_t4 		she washed out the bowl and it's completely empty ! 
_t4 		I think maybe the baby bear starts to cry at this point . 
_t4 		do you think so ? 
_t4 		and the papa bear says , don't worry we'll make you some more porridge . 
_t4 		so the bears ate all their porridge . 
_t4 		then when they were done eating they went upstairs to take a nap . 
_t4 		you're having sesame with apple+sauce  . 
_t4 		who likes the bagel in her porridge ? 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 		she likes bagels with porridge  . 
_t4 		hmmm , I'm just remembering something . 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 		um +... 
_t4 		they go upstairs and the papa bear says , somebody's [: somebody has] been sleeping in my bed . 
_t4 		the story of the day ? 
_t4 		I'm still telling the Goldilocks story . 
_t4 		you mean you wanna hear what we did yesterday ? 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		um yesterday was Wednesday . 
_t4 		we woke up +... 
_t4 		Mommy made coffee .

_t4 		we went to the bank . 
_t4 		we went to the hardware store . 
_t4 		we bought a rake at the hardware store just for you . 
_t4 		and then we went to the +... 
_t4 		we stopped in the shoe store for a minute . 
_t4 		we stopped to make sure that your shoes were still the right size . 
_t4 		that was very quick we didn't stay there for very long . 
_t4 		you have cold feet ? 
_t4 		really ? 
_t4 		it looks like there's some sun on your feet . 
_t4 		I can see it . 
_t4 		there on your left foot there's some sun yeah . 
_t4 		now it's in the sun can you feel the sun ? 
_t4 		I meant can your foot feel the sun ?

_t4 		Provincetown . 
_t4 		that's where they were having their vacation . 
_t4 		in Provincetown . 
_t4 		did you see a bird ? 
_t4 		no there's still some seeds there . 
_t4 		I think their seeds are all gone in the big feeder . 
_t4 		in this little feeder right here there's some seeds . 
_t4 		I can see them . 
_t4 		I think we've got_to get ready to go .
