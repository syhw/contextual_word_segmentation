_t4 		it's a little potty . 
_t4 		just , it's a little bit smaller than your potty . 
_t4 		can you sit on it and tell me if it fits you ? 
_t4 		very nice . 

_t4 		sometimes . 
_t4 		well no , I don't want those to go in there . 
_t4 		we can , you know what little later you can help me put them all in a bag . 
_t4 		there's something else in here for you too . 
_t4 		why don't you put those back . 
_t4 		and we'll see what else is in here for you besides the little +... 
_t4 		would you call this orange or yellow ? 
_t4 		yeah , I think it's probably yellow . 
_t4 		it's sort of +... 
_t4 		you know what , these are just used +... 

_t4 		oh and they're soft inside . 
_t4 		hmmm I hope they fit you , we'll have_to check and see if they fit . 

_t4 		two different more ,  . 
_t4 		more big kid pants . 

_t4 		it's very small , isn't it ? 
_t4 		wow , look at your feet go . 
_t4 		Mommy's making a tape of Naima . 

_t4 		that are glued to the bath+tub so that +... 
_t4 		no , so that a person taking a shower won't slip . 
_t4 		it's okay , they're just plastic . 

_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		I will hold you and hang up my laundry . 
_t4 		but , I would like you to know that there's nothing to be scared of with that piece of plastic . 
_t4 		I'm not doing anything to it . 
_t4 		it doesn't matter . 
_t4 		nothing needs to be done with it . 
_t4 		nothing at all . 
_t4 		yeah , plastic butterflies . 
_t4 		that's what they're for . 
_t4 		but you know what , we don't even use this bath+tub . 
_t4 		we don't even take showers in it . 
_t4 		do we ? 
_t4 		we just use it to hang clothes . 
_t4 		right ? 
_t4 		you wanna touch the +... 
_t4 		plastic butterfly . 
_t4 		wanna touch it ? 
_t4 		want Mommy to touch it ? 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		Mommy will touch it . 
_t4 		yeah , I'm rubbing it . 
_t4 		it's flat . 
_t4 		it's almost like a piece of paper . 
_t4 		here actually you know what , it peels right off . 
_t4 		this is it . 
_t4 		the plastic . 
_t4 		we could throw them in the garbage . 
_t4 		see , it's plastic . 
_t4 		should I see if I can get the other one off ? 
_t4 		you're standing on me . 
_t4 		let's see if I can get , peel the other one off too . 
_t4 		we don't really need to have them in here . 
_t4 		careful , boo . 
_t4 		this one is harder to get off . 
_t4 		do you want to  .
_t4 
_t4 		next to the toilet ? 
_t4 		you know that garbage and you lift up the lid and put the butterfly in the garbage . 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		yeah , we took it off and we +...
_t4 		put it in the and you , Naima , put it in the garbage . 
_t4 		well I tried to peel that one off , I had a little trouble . 
_t4 		(be)cause it's kinda [: kind of] stuck . 
_t4 		I'm not gonna do it right now , right now what I want to do is finish hanging up the laundry . 
_t4 		you are .
_t4 
_t4 		you smell very nice . 
_t4 		you were , but then you touched it and you put it in the garbage . 
_t4 		you're not scared of that anymore , I don't think so . 
_t4 		yeah you know what , I think that might be paint from something that you painted that was drying there . 
_t4 		I think that's what that is . 
_t4 		here's another sock you could hang up . 
_t4 		this is , no actually +... 
_t4 		(be)cause this is gray and that's black . 
_t4 		you're gonna need to look here . 
_t4 		try to find a gray sock that matches . 
_t4 		I don't know if it +... 
_t4 		it might not even be here . 
_t4 		let's see , where's the matching one ? 
_t4 		lalie , lalie , nursie ? 
_t4 		you can hang that up even though we don't have the matching one right now . 
_t4 		why don't you go and hang that up . 
_t4 		can I show you something ? 
_t4 		okay , watch me do it . 
_t4 		I'm putting it over , but then I'm gonna pull the other side . 
_t4 		because that way , it won't fall down easily . 
_t4 		yeah , that's another plastic butterfly . 
_t4 		there's another sock .
_t4 		who's sock is that ? 
_t4 		that's a Daddy sock , yeah . 

_t4 		try again , try again . 
_t4 		try hanging it up again . 
_t4 		no , use your other hand . 
_t4 		that's okay . 
_t4 		(o)kay , put it up there . 
_t4 		yes and then what you should do is hold onto it and then bring this down so that it hangs like that . 
_t4 		see that way it'll stay up , it won't fall down that way . 
_t4 		I'm showing you how to hang up the sock . 
_t4 		there's another sock . 
_t4 		try using both hands to make it stay . 
_t4 		like I showed you . 
