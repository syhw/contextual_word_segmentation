_t4 		thought I would try . 
_t4 		see , look at +//.
_t4 
_t4 		here's the dance giraffing [: giraffe] , making all these beautiful moves . 
_t4 		Gerald was a tall giraffe whose neck was long and slim . 
_t4 		but his knees were awfully crooked and his legs were rather thin . 
_t4 		he was very good and standing still and munching shoots off trees . 
_t4 		but when he tried to run around , he buckled at the knees . 
_t4 		now every year in Africa they hold the jungle dance . 
_t4 		where every single animal turns up to skip and prance . 
_t4 		and this year +//.
_t4 
_t4 		oh: , and this year when the day arrived , poor Gerald felt so sad . 
_t4 		because it +//.
_t4 
_t4 		when it came time to dance (.) he was really very bad . 
_t4 		the wart+hog started waltzing , and the rhinos rock and rolled +... 
_t4 		the lions danced the tango that was elegant and bold . 
_t4 		the chimps all did a cha+cha with a very latin  +//.
_t4 
_t4 		they're doing cha+cha , that's right +//.
_t4 
_t4 		and eight baboons then teamed up for a splendid Scottish  . 
_t4 		Gerald swallowed +//.
_t4 
_t4 		okay , alright , alright .
_t4 
_t4 		alright .
_t4 
_t4 		yeah !
_t4 
_t4 		yeah , those are the chimps doing cha+cha , see , and here they are watching . 
_t4 		Gerald swallowed bravely as he walked toward the floor , but +//.
_t4 
_t4 		no , they're not doing dancing , no they're watching . 
_t4 		but the lion saw him coming and they soon began to roar . 
_t4 		hey , look at clumsy Gerald , the animals all sneered +... 
_t4 		giraffes can't dance you silly fool ,  Gerald you're so weird . 
_t4 		Gerald simply froze up ,  he was rooted to the spot . 
_t4 		so he crept off from the dance floor and he started walking home . 
_t4 		he'd never felt so sad before , so sad and all alone . 
_t4 		then he found a little clearing and he looked up at the sky +... 
_t4 		the moon can be so beautiful , he whispered with a sigh . 
_t4 		excuse me , coughed a cricket who'd [: who had] seen Gerald earlier on . 
_t4 		but sometimes when you're different , you just need a different song . 
_t4 		listen to the swaying grass , and listen to the trees +... 
_t4 		to me the sweetest music is those branches in the breeze . 
_t4 		so imagine that the lovely moon is playing just for you .
_t4 
_t4 		that's Gerald (.) the giraffe . 
_t4 		everything makes music if you really want it to +... 
_t4 		yeah , wow . 
_t4 		that's what the  cricket's telling him , that if every +//.
_t4 
_t4 		that if he listens to the music of his own song , that he can ! 
_t4 		with that , the cricket smiled and picked up +//.
_t4 
_t4 		yeah what , listen +//.
_t4 
_t4 		the violin , that's right +//. 
_t4 		with that the cricket smiled , and picked up his violin . 
_t4 		then Gerald felt his body do the most amazing thing .
_t4 
_t4 		that's right . 
_t4 		his hooves had started shuffling ,  making circles on the ground . 
_t4 		his neck was gently swaying , and his tail was swishing (a)round . 
_t4 		he threw his arms out sideways , and he swung them everywhere . 
_t4 		then he did a backwards somersault , and leapt up in the air . 
_t4 		Gerald felt so wonderful , his mouth was open wide +... 
