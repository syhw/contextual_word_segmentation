_t4 		there's a giraffe dancing . 
_t4 		yeah the monkey . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		this is Gerald . 
_t4 		Gerald was a tall giraffe whose neck was long and slim +...
_t4 
_t4 		but his knees were awfully crooked and their legs +//. 
_t4 		his legs were (.) rather thin .
_t4 
_t4 		he was very good at standing still and munching shoots off trees . 
_t4 		but when he tried to run around , he buckled at the knees . 
_t4 		where every single animal turns up to skip and prance .
_t4 
_t4 		see here's a jungle dance . 
_t4 		and this year when the day arrived , poor Gerald felt so sad +... 
_t4 		because when it came to dancing , he was really very bad . 
_t4 		the lions danced the tango that was elegant and bold . 
_t4 		are they dancing ? 
_t4 		the chimps all did a cha+cha with a very latin feel .
_t4 
_t4 		that's right .
_t4 
_t4 		and eight baboons that +//. 
_t4 		and eight baboons that teamed up .
_t4 
_t4 		or a splendid Scottish  . 
_t4 		Gerald swallowed bravely as he walked toward the floor but the lions saw him coming and they soon began to roar . 
_t4 		hey look at clumsy Gerald the animals all sneered . 
_t4 		giraffes can't dance you silly fool . 
_t4 		oh Gerald you're so weird .
_t4 
_t4 		Gerald simply froze up .
_t4 
_t4 		he was rooted to the spot .
_t4 
_t4 		they're right he thought +...
_t4 
_t4 		I'm useless .
_t4 
_t4 		oh I feel like such a  .
_t4 
_t4 		yes , you're right . 
_t4 		so he crept off on the dance floor and he started walking home . 
_t4 		he'd never felt so sad before and so sad and so alone . 
_t4 		then he found a little clearing +... 
_t4 		and he looked up at the sky . 
_t4 		the moon can be so beautiful +... 
_t4 		he whispered with a sigh . 
_t4 		excuse me coughed a cricket , who'd seen Gerald early on . 
_t4 		but sometimes when you're different , you just need a different song . 
_t4 		listen to the swaying grass listen to the trees . 
_t4 		to me the sweetest music is those branches in the trees .
_t4 
_t4 		he's closing his eyes and he's listening +... 
_t4 		so imagine that the lovely moon is playing just for you .
_t4 
_t4 		everything makes music if you really want it to . 
_t4 		with that the cricket smiled and picked up his violin +... 
_t4 		and Gerald felt his body do the most amazing thing . 
_t4 		his hooves had started shuffling making circles on the ground . 
_t4 		his neck was gently swaying +... 
_t4 		and then he threw his arms out sideways and he swung them everywhere . 
_t4 		then he did a backwards somersault and leaped up in the air . 
_t4 		Gerald felt so wonderful . 
_t4 		his mouth was open wide .
_t4 
_t4 		I'm dancing yes I'm dancing . 
_t4 		I'm dancing Gerald cried . 
_t4 		then one by one each animal who'd been there at the dance arrived with Gerald  and watched him quite entranced .
_t4 
_t4 		they shouted it's a miracle: .
_t4 
_t4 		yeah it's a miracle . 
_t4 		we must be in a dream .
_t4 
_t4 		Gerald's [: Gerald is] the best dancer that we've ever ever seen . 
_t4 		how did you learn to dance like that ? 
_t4 		please Gerald tell us how .
_t4 
_t4 		but Gerald simply twirled around and finished with a bow . 
_t4 		then he raised his head and looked up at the moon and stars above . 
_t4 		we all can dance he said when we find the music that we love .
_t4 
_t4 		okay let's read the ducks .

_t4 		that sounds like a good idea mom . 
_t4 		this is called make way for ducklings by Robert McCloskey . 
_t4 		Mr and Mrs Mallard were looking for a place to live . 
_t4 		but everytime Mr Mallard saw what looked like a nice place , Mrs Mallard said it was no good . 
_t4 		there was sure to be foxes in the woods or turtles in the water . 
_t4 		and she was not going to raise a family where there might be foxes and turtles . 
_t4 		so they flew on and on . 
_t4 		when they got_to Boston , they felt too tired to fly any farther . 
_t4 		there was a nice pond in the public gardens +... 
_t4 		with a little island on it . 
_t4 		the very place to spend the night quacked Mr Mallard . 
_t4 		so they +//. 
_t4 		so down they went .
_t4 
_t4 		next morning they fished for their breakfast in the (.) in the mud at the bottom of the pond . 
_t4 		but they didn't find much . 
_t4 		just as they were getting ready to start on their way a strange and enormous bird came by . 
_t4 		it was pushing a boat full of people and there was a man sitting on its back . 
_t4 		good morning quacked Mr Mallard , being polite . 
_t4 		the big bird was too proud to answer . 
_t4 		the people on the boat threw peanuts into the water and so the Mallards followed them all around the pond and got another breakfast . 
_t4 		better than the first . 
_t4 		I like this place said Mrs Mallard +... 
_t4 		as they climbed out on the bank . 
_t4 		and waddled along . 
_t4 		why don't we build a nest and raise our ducklings right in this pond . 
_t4 		there are no foxes and no turtles and the people feed us peanuts . 
_t4 		what could be better ? 
_t4 		good said Mr Mallard , delighted at last Mrs Mallard had found a place that suited her . 
_t4 		but +... 
_t4 		look out squawked Mrs Mallard . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		you'll get run over . 
_t4 		and when she caught her breath she added this is no place for babies .
_t4 
_t4 		with all those horrid things rushing about we'll have_to look somewhere else . 
_t4 		what's that ? 
_t4 		it's a bicycle .
_t4 
_t4 		that's right . 
_t4 		pedals . 
_t4 		so they flew over Beacon Hill and around the State House . 
_t4 		but there's no place there . 
_t4 		but there was no water to swim in . 
_t4 		then they flew over the Charles River . 
_t4 		this is better quacked Mrs Mallard . 
_t4 		xxx looks like (.) quite (.) like a nice quiet place . 
_t4 		it's only a little away from the public garden . 
_t4 		yes said Mrs Mallard , remembering the peanuts . 
_t4 		that looks just (.) that looks like just the right place to hatch ducklings . 
_t4 		so they chose a cozy spot on one of the bushes near the water and settled down to build their nest . 
_t4 		and only just in time for now they were beginning to  . 
_t4 		all their old wing feathers start to drop out . 
_t4 		and would not be able to fly again until the new ones grew in . 
_t4 		but of course they could swim and one day they swam over to the park on the river  and there they met a policeman called Michael . 
_t4 		Michael fed them peanuts . 
_t4 		and after that the Mallards called upon Michael every day . 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		after Mrs Mallard had laid eight eggs in the nest she couldn't go visit Michael anymore . 
_t4 		(be)cause she had to sit on the eggs to keep them warm . 
_t4 		she moved off the nest only to get a drink of water or to have her lunch or to count the eggs and make sure they were all there . 
_t4 		one day the ducklings hatched out . 
_t4 		first came Jack , then Pack , then Lack , then Mack , and Nack , and Wack , and Pack , and Quack .
_t4 
_t4 		Mr and Mrs Mallard were bursting with pride . 
_t4 		it's a great responsibility taking care of so many ducklings and they kept them very busy . 
_t4 		yeah there's a mommy . 
_t4 		one day +... 
_t4 		Mr Mallard decided he'd like to take a trip to see what the rest of the river was like . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		off he sat (.) set +... 
_t4 		I'll meet you in a week in the public garden he quacked over his shoulder .
_t4 
_t4 		take good care of the ducklings .
_t4 
_t4 		don't you worry said Mrs Mallard I know all about bringing up children . 
_t4 		and she did . 
_t4 		she taught them how to swim +... 
_t4 		and di:ve . 
_t4 		she taught them to walk in a lines , to come when they were called , and to keep a safe distance from bikes and scooters and other things with wheels . 
_t4 		when at last she felt perfectly satisfied with them , she said one morning come along children follow me . 
_t4 		just as they had been taught . 
_t4 		Mrs Mallard led the way to the water and they swam behind her to the opposite bank . 

_t4 
_t4 		here's the dance giraffing [: giraffe] , making all these beautiful moves . 
_t4 		Gerald was a tall giraffe whose neck was long and slim . 
_t4 		but his knees were awfully crooked and his legs were rather thin . 
_t4 		he was very good and standing still and munching shoots off trees . 
_t4 		but when he tried to run around , he buckled at the knees . 
_t4 		now every year in Africa they hold the jungle dance . 
_t4 		where every single animal turns up to skip and prance . 
_t4 		and this year +//.
_t4 
_t4 		oh: , and this year when the day arrived , poor Gerald felt so sad . 
_t4 		because it +//.
_t4 
_t4 		when it came time to dance (.) he was really very bad . 
_t4 		the wart+hog started waltzing , and the rhinos rock and rolled +... 
_t4 		the lions danced the tango that was elegant and bold . 
_t4 		the chimps all did a cha+cha with a very latin  +//.
_t4 
_t4 		they're doing cha+cha , that's right +//.
_t4 
_t4 		and eight baboons then teamed up for a splendid Scottish  . 
_t4 		Gerald swallowed +//.
_t4 
_t4 		okay , alright , alright .
_t4 
_t4 		alright .
_t4 
_t4 		yeah !
_t4 
_t4 		yeah , those are the chimps doing cha+cha , see , and here they are watching . 
_t4 		Gerald swallowed bravely as he walked toward the floor , but +//.
_t4 
_t4 		no , they're not doing dancing , no they're watching . 
_t4 		but the lion saw him coming and they soon began to roar . 
_t4 		hey , look at clumsy Gerald , the animals all sneered +... 
_t4 		giraffes can't dance you silly fool ,  Gerald you're so weird . 
_t4 		Gerald simply froze up ,  he was rooted to the spot . 
_t4 		so he crept off from the dance floor and he started walking home . 
_t4 		he'd never felt so sad before , so sad and all alone . 
_t4 		then he found a little clearing and he looked up at the sky +... 
_t4 		the moon can be so beautiful , he whispered with a sigh . 
_t4 		excuse me , coughed a cricket who'd [: who had] seen Gerald earlier on . 
_t4 		but sometimes when you're different , you just need a different song . 
_t4 		listen to the swaying grass , and listen to the trees +... 
_t4 		to me the sweetest music is those branches in the breeze . 
_t4 		so imagine that the lovely moon is playing just for you .
_t4 
_t4 		that's Gerald (.) the giraffe . 
_t4 		everything makes music if you really want it to +... 
_t4 		yeah , wow . 
_t4 		that's what the  cricket's telling him , that if every +//.
_t4 
_t4 		that if he listens to the music of his own song , that he can ! 
_t4 		with that , the cricket smiled and picked up +//.
_t4 
_t4 		yeah what , listen +//.
_t4 
_t4 		the violin , that's right +//. 
_t4 		with that the cricket smiled , and picked up his violin . 
_t4 		then Gerald felt his body do the most amazing thing .
_t4 
_t4 		that's right . 
_t4 		his hooves had started shuffling ,  making circles on the ground . 
_t4 		his neck was gently swaying , and his tail was swishing (a)round . 
_t4 		he threw his arms out sideways , and he swung them everywhere . 
_t4 		then he did a backwards somersault , and leapt up in the air . 
_t4 		Gerald felt so wonderful , his mouth was open wide +... 
_t4 		I'm dancing , yes I'm dancing , I'm dancing , Gerald cried . 
_t4 		then one by one each animal who'd [: who had] been there at the dance +... 
_t4 		arrived while Gerald boogied on +//.
_t4 
_t4 		and watched him , quite entranced . 
_t4 		they shouted , it's a miracle , we must be in a dream ! 
_t4 		yeah , Gerald's [: Gerald is] the best dancer that we've ever , ever seen ! 
_t4 		how did you learn how to dance like that , please Gerald , tell us how ? 
_t4 		but Gerald simply twirled around and finished with a bow . 
_t4 		and he raised his head and looked up at the moon and stars above . 
_t4 		we all can dance , he said , when we find music that we love . 
