_d3042 		me on our egg . 

_d3042 		go fly off and take it . 
_d3042 		I'll sit on your egg and try not to break it . 
_d3042 		hmmm , the first thing to do murmured Horton , let's see . 
_d3042 		first thing to do is to prop up this tree . 
_d3042 		and make it much stronger that has to be done . 
_d3042 		before I get on , I must weigh a +//. 
_d3042 		a ton . 
_d3042 		then Horton the elephant smiled . 
_d3042 		now that's that . 
_d3042 		and he sat and he sat and he sat and he sat . 
_d3042 		and sat all that day and kept the egg warm .
_d3042 
_d3042 		it's raining . 
_d3042 		it's raining very hard , isn't it ? 
_d3042 		through a terrible storm . 
_d3042 		and it poured and it lightning . 
_d3042 		it thundered and rumbled . 
_d3042 		this isn't much fun , the elephant grumbled . 
_d3042 		but Mazy by that time was far beyond reach . 
_d3042 		enjoying the sunshine , way off in Palm Beach . 
_d3042 		and having such fun , such a wonderful rest . 
_d3042 		decided she'd never go back to her nest . 
_d3042 		oh no . 
_d3042 		there's snow all over Horton . 
_d3042 		so Horton kept sitting there day after day . 
_d3042 		and soon it was autumn the leaves blew away . 
_d3042 		and then came the winter . 
_d3042 		the snow and the sleet . 
_d3042 		and the icicles hung from his trunk and his feet . 
_d3042 		so  , poor Horton sat there the whole winter through .
_d3042 
_d3042 		he's all clean now . 
_d3042 		and then came spring time with troubles anew . 
_d3042 		his friends gathered round and shouted with glee . 
_d3042 		look Horton the elephant is up in a tree . 
_d3042 		they taunted and teased him and said how absurd . 
_d3042 		old Horton the elephant thinks he's a bird . 
_d3042 		no matter what happens this egg must be tended . 
_d3042 		but poor Horton .
_d3042 
_d3042 		right .
_d3042 
_d3042 		they are wearing suits . 
_d3042 		black eyes right . 
_d3042 		three hunters came up softly from behind . 
_d3042 		he heard the men's footsteps and turned with a start . 
_d3042 		three rifles were aiming right straight at his heart . 
_d3042 		did he run ? 
_d3042 		he did not .
_d3042 
_d3042 		Horton stayed on that nest . 
_d3042 		held his head high . 
_d3042 		and threw out his chest . 
_d3042 		and he looked at the hunters as much as to say . 
_d3042 		shoot if you must but I won't run away . 
_d3042 		but the men didn't shoot much to his surprise . 
_d3042 		they dropped their three guns and stared with wide eyes . 
_d3042 		hmmm . 
_d3042 		and the first thing he knew they had built a big wagon .
_d3042 
_d3042 		yeah that's one of the hunters . 
_d3042 		and dug up his tree and put it inside . 
_d3042 		with Horton so sad he practically cried . 
_d3042 		up out of the jungle up into the sky . 
_d3042 		up over the mountains +...
_d3042 
_d3042 		is that a baby elephant ? 
_d3042 		oh .
_d3042 
_d3042 		then down down the mountains and down into the sea went the cart and the elephant . 
_d3042 		with nest and tree . 
_d3042 		that's one of the hunters .
_d3042 
_d3042 		he's pushing that cart . 
_d3042 		there's a fish .

_d3042 		over the ocean and  what a trip . 
_d3042 		rolling and tossing and splash with the spray . 
_d3042 		and Horton said day after day after day . 
_d3042 		I meant what I said and I said what I meant . 
_d3042 		but  am I sea sick . 
_d3042 		one hundred percent . 
_d3042 		after bobbing around two week on the port .

_d3042 		they landed at last in the town of +//. 
_d3042 		New York . 
_d3042 		all a shore the men shouted and down with a lurch . 
_d3042 		and Horton the elephant still on his perch . 
_d3042 		tied on to a board that could just scarcely hold him . 
_d3042 		bump (.) Horton landed and then the men sold him . 
_d3042 		my daddy works in Boston .

_d3042 		then one day the circus show happened to reach , a town way down south not far from Palm Beach . 
_d3042 		and dawdling along way up high in the sky . 
_d3042 		who of all people should chance to fly by . 
_d3042 		but that old good for nothing bird , run away Mazy . 
_d3042 		still on vacation and still just as lazy . 
_d3042 		and she swooped from the clouds through an open tent door . 
_d3042 		good gracious gasped Mazy , I've seen you before . 
_d3042 		poor Horton looked up with his face white as chalk . 
_d3042 		he started to speak but before he could talk . 
_d3042 		they rang out the noisiest ear splitting squeaks from the egg he had sat on for fifty one weeks . 
_d3042 		a thumping a bumping a wild alive scratching . 
_d3042 		my egg shouted Horton my egg ! 

_d3042 		but at that very instant the egg burst apart .
_d3042 
_d3042 		the baby came out of the egg . 

_d3063 		good afternoon it said in a small clear voice . 
_d3063 		can I help you ? 
_d3063 		we were wondering if we could help you said Mrs Brown . 
_d3063 		where ever have you come from ? 
_d3063 		the bear looked around carefully before replying . 
_d3063 		darkest Peru . 
_d3063 		I stowed away and lived on Marmalade . 
_d3063 		it said simply please look after this bear . 

_d3063 		aunt Lucy . 
_d3063 		Henry she exclaimed we shall have_to take him home with us . 
_d3063 		but we don't even know his name began Mr Brown . 
_d3063 		we'll call him +//. 
_d3063 		Paddington said Mrs Brown . 
_d3063 		because that's where we +//. 
_d3063 		found him . 
_d3063 		Mrs Brown went off to look Judy and Mr Brown took Paddington into the cafeteria for something to eat . 
_d3063 		he left Paddington sitting at a table in the corner near the window . 
_d3063 		and he soon returned carrying two steaming cups of tea and a large plate piled high with +//. 
_d3063 		sticky cakes . 
_d3063 		after his long journey Paddington felt so hungry and thirsty he didn't know which to do first eat or drink . 
_d3063 		I think I'll try both at the same time if you don't mind Mr Brown he announced . 
_d3063 		and without waiting for a reply he climbed up on to the table . 
_d3063 		Mr Brown steered out of the window pretending he had tea with a bear at Paddington station everyday of his life . 
_d3063 		what's Paddington doing ? 
_d3063 		oh+my+goodness . 
_d3063 		he's standing on the table . 
_d3063 		when Mrs Brown came into the cafeteria with Judy she threw her hands up with horror . 
_d3063 		Henry she said what are you doing to that poor bear . 
_d3063 		he's covered all over with cream and jam . 
_d3063 		oh is that the mommy . 
_d3063 		that's Mrs Brown the mommy . 
_d3063 		and there's the daddy . 
_d3063 		and +//. 

_d3063 		right . 
_d3063 		I think we better go before anything else happens said Mr Brown . 
_d3063 		and quickly led the way out of the cafeteria . 
_d3063 		Judy took Paddington's paw and squeezed it . 
_d3063 		what's on Paddington's foot ? 
_d3063 		is that a cup ? 
_d3063 		oh+my+goodness . 
_d3063 		that is so messy . 
_d3063 		come along she said we'll take you home in a taxi . 
_d3063 		and you both can have a nice hot bath . 
_d3063 		Paddington had never been in a taxi before . 
_d3063 		do you remember what color the taxis are in New York ? 
_d3063 		in New York are they yellow ? 
_d3063 		yes . 
_d3063 		he found it very exciting and stood on a lil [: little] tip up seat behind the driver so he could wave to the people on the street . 
_d3063 		oh that's okay sweetie . 
_d3063 		you want that ? 
_d3063 		soon they pulled up outside a large house with a green front door . 
_d3063 		when they were indoors Judy took Paddington up to his room to unpack . 
_d3063 		I haven't gotten very much said Paddington only some marmalade . 
_d3063 		and my scrapbook . 
_d3063 		and this sort of South American penny . 
_d3063 		he held up a photograph and that's my aunt Lucy . 
_d3063 		she had it taken right before she went into the home for retired bears . 
_d3063 		what does that look like ? 
_d3063 		it looks like a dime ? 
_d3063 		I think it's a sort of penny . 
_d3063 		it's a type of penny . 
_d3063 		next Judy showed Paddington to the bathroom . 
_d3063 		as soon as he was on his own he turned on the taps and climbed onto a stool to look out the window . 
_d3063 		then he tried writing his name on the steamy glass with his paw . 
_d3063 		it took him rather a long time . 
_d3063 		and when he looked around he found his surprise the bath was so full of water it started to run over the side . 
_d3063 		oh no . 
_d3063 		he closed his eyes and holding his nose with one paw . 
_d3063 		he jumped in . 
_d3063 		the water was hot soapy and very deep . 
_d3063 		then to his horror he found he couldn't get out . 
_d3063 		he couldn't even see to turn the taps off . 
_d3063 		oh no ! 
_d3063 		Paddington tried calling out help at first in a quiet voice so it's not to disturb anyone and then much louder . 
_d3063 		help help ! 
_d3063 		but still nobody came . 
_d3063 		then he had an idea . 
_d3063 		he took off his hat and began to use it to bail out the water . 
_d3063 		downstairs Judy was telling her brother all about Paddington . 
_d3063 		when suddenly she felt a plop . 
_d3063 		looking up she saw a dark wet patch on the ceiling . 
_d3063 		Paddington she called he must be in trouble . 
_d3063 		quick ! 
_d3063 		and together they raced out of the room . 
_d3063 		Jonathan and Judy leaned over the side of the bath and lifted a dripping and very frightened Paddington onto the floor . 
_d3063 		what a mess said Jonathan . 
_d3063 		we better wipe it up pretty quickly . 
_d3063 		oh Paddington said Judy what good luck we found you .
_d3063 
_d3063 		look at all that water on Paddington . 
_d3063 		they took him out of the bath tub . 
_d3063 		he's so wet isn't he ? 
_d3063 		yes . 
_d3063 		Paddington sat up and said what good luck I had my hat . 
_d3063 		sometime later a beautifully clean Paddington came downstairs . 
_d3063 		settling himself down in a small arm chair by the fire . 
_d3063 		he put his paws behind his head and stretched out his toes . 
_d3063 		it was nice being a bear . 
_d3063 		especially a bear called Paddington . 

_d3063 
_d3063 		oh Paddington's garden . 
_d3063 		Paddington's garden . 
_d3063 		one day Paddington decided to make a list of all the nice things there were about being a bear and living with the Brown's at number thirty two Winsor Gardens . 
_d3063 		it was a long list and he had almost reached the end of the paper when he suddenly realized he left out one of the nicest things of all . 
_d3063 		the garden itself . 
_d3063 		wow that's nice . 
_d3063 		Paddington liked the Brown's garden . 
_d3063 		it was quiet and peacefully and there were times when it might not have been in London at all . 
_d3063 		but nice gardens usually mean a lot of hard work . 
_d3063 		and after a day at his office Mr Brown often wished it wasn't quite so large . 
_d3063 		what's that ? 
_d3063 		there's Mrs Brown she's the mommy . 
_d3063 		and the daddy too . 
_d3063 		it was Mrs Brown who first thought of giving Jonathan Judy and Paddington a piece each of their own . 
_d3063 		it will keep them out of mischief she said . 
_d3063 		and will help you at the same time . 
_d3063 		so Mr Brown marked up three squares and to make it more exciting he said he would give a price to whom ever had the best idea . 
_d3063 		early next morning all three set to work . 
_d3063 		Judy thought she would grow some flowers and Jonathan started to make a paved garden . 
_d3063 		but Paddington didn't know what to do . 
_d3063 		gardening was much harder than it looked . 
_d3063 		especially with paws and he soon grew tired of digging . 
_d3063 		in the end he decided to do some shopping . 
_d3063 		he had some savings .
_d3063 
_d3063 		oh look he's buying what's he buying ? 
_d3063 		seeds . 
_d3063 		and he has a basket . 
_d3063 		and the trowel . 
_d3063 		and he's gonna buy a lil [: little] wheel barrel to . 
_d3063 		it seemed very good value indeed . 
_d3063 		especially since he had two pence left over . 
_d3063 		the shop keeper told him that when planning a new garden it was a good idea to stand some way away first in order to picture what it would look like when it was finished . 
_d3063 		so taking a jar of his best chunky marmalade . 
_d3063 		Paddington set out to visit the near by building site . 
_d3063 		by the time he got there it was the middle of the morning . 
_d3063 		and as the men were all at their tea break he sat down on a pile of bricks . 
_d3063 		and put down his jar of marmalade . 
_d3063 		hmmm . 
_d3063 		after sitting there for some while without getting a single idea pit . 
_d3063 		Paddington decided to take a short walk instead . 
_d3063 		when he got back his eyes nearly popped out . 
_d3063 		a man was emptying the concrete mixer on the very spot where he had left his jar of marmalade . 
_d3063 		oh my ! 
_d3063 		at that moment the foreman came round and seen the look on Paddington's face . 
_d3063 		he stopped to ask what was wrong . 
_d3063 		oh my chunks have been buried he exclaimed hotly . 
_d3063 		so they all set to work clearing the cement . 
_d3063 		but there was no sign of Paddington's jar . 
_d3063 		suddenly there was a worrying sound from over head . 
_d3063 		a platform landed at his feet . 
_d3063 		my marmalade he said . 
_d3063 		I put it there ready for my tea break and it must have been taken out by mistake . 
_d3063 		that's quick drying cement . 
_d3063 		it's probably rock hard . 
_d3063 		and no one will give me two pence for it now . 
_d3063 		I will said Paddington . 
_d3063 		and he took the lumps of concrete home . 
_d3063 		when the builders saw +...
_d3063 
_d3063 		there's his wheelbarrow . 
_d3063 		and his concrete and his trowel . 
_d3063 		concrete . 
_d3063 		wheelbarrow . 
_d3063 		trowel . 
_d3063 		trowel . 
_d3063 		and his seeds started to grow . 
_d3063 		and they celebrated by having tea in the new garden . 
_d3063 		after it was over Paddington stayed on for a while in order to finish his list of all the nice things there were . 
_d3063 		about being a bear and living at thiry+two Winsor Gardens . 
_d3063 		he had one more important item to add . 
_d3063 		my rockery . 
_d3063 		and signed his name and added his special paw print just to show that it was +//. 
_d3063 		genuine . 
_d3063 		very good .
_d3063 
_d3063 		yay !
_d3063

_d3079 
_d3079 		that's his daddy . 
_d3079 		you're right . 
_d3079 		Dandelion woke up stretched and yawned and jumped out of bed . 
_d3079 		after doing his daily exercises . 
_d3079 		Dandelion looked out of the window . 
_d3079 		blinked his eyes and said I wonder if the mail has come . 
_d3079 		he put on his sweater and went outside to the mail box . 
_d3079 		there was a letter and it was written in fancy gold ink . 
_d3079 		dear Dandelion you are invited to my tea and taffy party on Saturday afternoon at half passed three . 
_d3079 		come as you are . 
_d3079 		sincerely Jennifer Giraffe . 
_d3079 		Dandelion was very excited . 
_d3079 		it's a good thing I'm getting a hair cut today he said . 
_d3079 		as soon as he washed and dried the dishes . 
_d3079 		and made his bed nice and neat . 
_d3079 		he ran down the street to the barber shop . 
_d3079 		Lou Kangaroo had a chair waiting for him . 
_d3079 		and then gave him a shampoo . 
_d3079 		Dandelion thought he should have a manicure to . 
_d3079 		right he's cleaning his nails . 
_d3079 		when Lou Kangaroo had finished Dandelion looked a bit foolish . 
_d3079 		xxx silly . 
_d3079 		maybe a wave would help Lou suggested showing him a picture in the latest fashion magazine for lions . 
_d3079 		Dandelion agreed . 
_d3079 		this was exactly what he needed . 
_d3079 		so Lou went about curling his mane . 
_d3079 		he looked +...
_d3079 
_d3079 		magnificent . 
_d3079 		but now +...
_d3079

_d3079 		magnificent . 
_d3079 		magnificent . 
_d3079 		very good honey . 
_d3079 		but now Dandelion thought he really should wear something more elegant than a sweater to the party . 
_d3079 		this jacket is the very newest style said Theodore the tailor . 
_d3079 		and it just fits you . 
_d3079 		all you need now is a cap and a cane . 
_d3079 		Happy Crane will be happy to help you . 
_d3079 		what a damper dandy he had suddenly become .
_d3079 
_d3079 		that's Happy Crane . 
_d3079 		it's nearly half past three said Dandelion . 
_d3079 		I've just time to get something for my hostess . 
_d3079 		a bouquet of dandelions would be perfect . 
_d3079 		he knew this tall door very well . 
_d3079 		having been here many times before . 
_d3079 		he rang the bell . 
_d3079 		when Jennifer Giraffe opened the door she looked very surprised . 
_d3079 		yes she said . 
_d3079 		what can I do for you ? 
_d3079 		but I'm here for your party he said . 
_d3079 		why I'm sorry sir you are not anyone I know she said . 
_d3079 		you must have the wrong address . 
_d3079 		and with that she closed the door right in poor Dandelion's face . 
_d3079 		I'm Dandelion he roared you've made a mining mistake . 
_d3079 		but the door stayed tight shut . 
_d3079 		Dandelion walked back and forth down the block . 
_d3079 		and as he paced +...
_d3079 
_d3079 		he is sad .
_d3079 
_d3079 		the sky grew dark . 
_d3079 		and a sudden gust of wind sprang up and blew away his beautiful bouquet . 
_d3079 		they blew away in the wind . 
_d3079 		oh no . 
_d3079 		to make matters worse it began to rain in ? 
_d3079 		Torrance . 
_d3079 		Dandelion dropped his cane . 
_d3079 		and stood under a weeping willow tree . 
_d3079 		but the rain pored down through the branches . 
_d3079 		Dandelion was soon soak and wet and his curls came unfurled . 
_d3079 		he took off his jacket . 
_d3079 		and hung it on a willow branch . 
_d3079 		luckily he had kept on his sweater . 
_d3079 		at last the rain stopped . 
_d3079 		and the warm sunshine came down . 
_d3079 		huh while he sat there waiting he spotted three dandelion flowers .
_d3079 
_d3079 		more dandelions . 
_d3079 		they had been protected .
_d3079 
_d3079 		they didn't blow away . 
_d3079 		they had protected from the wind and rain . 
_d3079 		he picked the dandelions and said I think I will try again . 
_d3079 		and rang the bell . 
_d3079 		well if it isn't our friend Dandelion . 
_d3079 		we've been waiting for over an hour for you . 
_d3079 		I do hope you weren't caught in that awful cloud burst . 
_d3079 		everyone at the party greeted him hardly . 
_d3079 		and Jennifer Giraffe told Dandelion about the silly looking lion that had come to the door . 
_d3079 		Dandelion almost spilt his cup of tea . 
_d3079 		that was me I was the silly looking one .
_d3079 
_d3079 		what's he drinking ? 
_d3079 		is it delicious ? 

_d3079 		and I promise you I will never again try to turn myself into a stylish dandy said Dandelion . 

_d3096 		Chester swallowed one to . 

_d3096 		Chester duplicated his Christmas list every year and gave a copy to Wilson because they always wanted to same things anyway . 
_d3096 		for Halloween they would always dress as things that went together . 

_d3096 		she talked backwards to herself sometimes so no one would know what she was saying . 
_d3096 		and she never left the house without one of her nifty disguises . 
_d3096 		Lily waved at all the cars that passed by even if she didn't know who was in them . 
_d3096 		and she always carried a loaded squirt gun in her back pocket just in case . 
_d3096 		she definitely has a mind of her own said Chester . 
_d3096 		that's one way to put it said Wilson . 
_d3096 		when Lily asked Chester and Wilson to play they said they were busy . 
_d3096 		when she called them at home they disguised their voices and said they weren't home . 
_d3096 		if Lily was walking on one side of the street Chester and Wilson crossed to the other side and hid . 
_d3096 		she's something else said Chester . 
_d3096 		looks like it said Wilson . 
