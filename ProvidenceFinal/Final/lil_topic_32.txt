_t4 
_t4 		Cinderella .
_t4 
_t4 		every day , Cinderella woke up early to do chores for her stepmother and stepsisters . 
_t4 		from morning to night , she , they gave her things to do . 
_t4 		one morning , a messenger came from the palace to invite Cinderella and her stepsisters to a royal ball ! 
_t4 		oh , a little bird wearing a pink hat . 
_t4 		wow .
_t4 
_t4 		yellow hat .
_t4 
_t4 		and a green hat too .
_t4 
_t4 		Cinderella was very excited , but her stepmother gave her a long list of chores to do before she could go . 
_t4 		while Cinderella was busy working , the birds and mice began fixing an old dress that had belonged to Cinderella's mother . 
_t4 		before long , they made Cinderella a beautiful gown . 
_t4 		by the time Cinderella finished her chores , she thought it was too late to get ready for the ball +... 
_t4 		and was very sad . 
_t4 		surprise , the birds and mice gave Cinderella the finished gown . 
_t4 		oh , thank you so much , she said . 
_t4 		Cinderella got dressed and rushed to join her stepsisters , but when they saw her they became so jealous they tore her lovely gown to pieces . 
_t4 		oh no , they tore her gown .
_t4 
_t4 		that wasn't very nice . 
_t4 		Cinderella ran to the garden and wept . 
_t4 		just then , sparkling lights swirled all around . 
_t4 		xxx , it was her +... 
_t4 		who was it ?
_t4 
_t4 		who is that ? 
_t4 		xxx , it's her fairy godmother !
_t4 
_t4 		dry those tears , she said , you can't go to the ball looking like that . 
_t4 		with a wave of her magic wand , the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach and Cinderella's rags into a gorgeous gown . 
_t4 		and with one more wave , Cinderella had tiny glass slippers on her feet . 
_t4 		before Cinderella left for the ball , she received a warning . 
_t4 		on the stroke of midnight the spell will be broken and everything will be as before . 
_t4 		I must go , Cinderella cried . 
_t4 		and as she fled , she lost a +... 
_t4 		a glass slipper on the staircase .
_t4 
_t4 		the next day , the prince announced he wanted to marry the girl who had lost her glass slipper . 
_t4 		let me out , Cinderella cried . 
_t4 		the grand duke went to every home in the kingdom looking for the maiden whose foot fit the tiny glass shoe . 
_t4 		when the grand duke put the slipper on Cinderella's foot +... 
_t4 		it fit perfectly .
_t4 
_t4 		soon after , Cinderella and the prince were married , and they lived happily ever after . 
_t4 		that one ,  , look who that is . 
_t4 		that's Snow white . 
_t4 		oh yes .
_t4 
_t4 		long ago , there lived a lovely princess named Snow white . 
_t4 		oh , she's wearing a blue bow in her hair . 
_t4 		each day the queen would ask , magic mirror on the wall , who's the fairest one of all ? 
_t4 		and the mirror would always answer , you are . 
_t4 		one day the mirror said , a lovely maid I see , who is more fair than thee . 
_t4 		the queen knew , it must be Snow white . 
_t4 		Snow white was so beautiful and kind , that even a handsome prince who was passing by soon noticed her . 
_t4 		little did he know that when he came into the courtyard to sing to Snow white , the evil queen was watching nearby . 
_t4 		the queen was very jealous .
_t4 
_t4 		ooh , now she's wearing a red bow , you're right .
_t4 
_t4 		Snow white realized she must leave home or risk being hurt by the queen . 
_t4 		Snow white was so frightened that she ran deep into the forest . 
_t4 		do you know where I can stay , she asked a group of friendly animals . 
_t4 		what kind of animals are there ? 
_t4 		some bunny rabbits and +...
_t4 
_t4 		a turtle .
_t4 
_t4 		that's right , and you know what this is ?
_t4 
_t4 		a raccoon , and , you know what these are ?
_t4 
_t4 		those are little deer .
_t4 
_t4 		and  , that's a little chipmunk .
_t4 
_t4 		right .
_t4 
_t4 		chipmunks . 
_t4 		and a squirrel , and  !
_t4 
_t4 		mushrooms , wow .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx look it looks like a reindeer , that's right .
_t4 
_t4 		oh , it is a reindeer , okay .
_t4 
_t4 		I think it might be , yes .
_t4 
_t4 		yes , I think so .
_t4 
_t4 		I think you're right .
_t4 
_t4 		the animals led Snow white to a tiny cottage in the woods . 
_t4 		she knocked on the door but no one answered . 
_t4 		so she slowly stepped inside . 
_t4 		Snow white found seven tiny bowls , seven tiny chairs , and seven tiny beds . 
_t4 		but the cottage was a mess ! 
_t4 		oh my , there must be seven tiny children living here ! 
_t4 		let's clean the house and surprise them , she said to the animals . 
_t4 		and then maybe they'll let me stay . 
_t4 		soon seven tiny men arrived , the seven dwarves . 
_t4 		Snow white promised to wash and sew and sweep for the little men . 
_t4 		in return , they kept her safe and happy . 
_t4 		the seven dwarfs loved having Snow white stay in their cottage . 
_t4 		back at the castle , the magic mirror told the queen where Snow white was hiding . 
_t4 		the queen was so angry that she drank a potion and turned herself into an old hag . 
_t4 		and then she created a magic apple . 
_t4 		with one bite of this poisoned apple , Snow white's eyes will close forever . 
_t4 		as soon as the dwarves went to work , the queen , disguised as a peddler woman , approached Snow white . 
_t4 		the forest animals recognized the queen and ran off to warn the dwarves . 
_t4 		but by the time the dwarves arrived , it was too late . 
_t4 		Snow white had already taken a bite of the poisoned apple , and +/.
_t4 
_t4 		she took a bite of that  apple , and she fell asleep .
_t4 
_t4 		oh my . 
_t4 		the evil queen fled from the cottage but the seven dwarves raced after her and chased her to a rocky cliff . 
_t4 		well , the the seven dwarves are angry at the witch , because she's not very nice to Snow white .
_t4 
_t4 		well , the seven dwarves are nice , they're just angry . 
_t4 		a rock broke beneath her feet and the queen fell from the mountaintop into the darkness below . 
