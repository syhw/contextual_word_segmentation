_d3610 		you wanna finish Lion king , or you wanna read Franklin ? 
_d3610 		alright , let's see where we were . 
_d3610 		later , as Simba headed down the path , he ran into Scar .
_d3610 
_d3610 		hey uncle Scar , guess what , I'm gonna be king of Pride land . 
_d3610 		of Pride rock . 
_d3610 		my dad just showed me the whole kingdom , and I'm gonna rule it all . 
_d3610 		Scar looked slyly at the young cub . 
_d3610 		he didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border , did he ? 
_d3610 		well , no , he said I can't go there . 
_d3610 		oh he's right , said Scar , it's far too dangerous . 
_d3610 		only the bravest lions go there . 
_d3610 		come on , I just heard about this great place he said . 
_d3610 		the mothers gave permission for the youngsters to go as long as Zazu went with them . 
_d3610 		Simba and Nala raced across the Pride lands in an effort to lose the watchful bird . 
_d3610 		Nala led him through many herds of animals until they finally lost him . 
_d3610 		once the cubs were free of Zazu , Simba pounced on Nala . 
_d3610 		then Nala flipped Simba onto his back . 
_d3610 		they tumbled down a hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones . 
_d3610 		Simba looked around and gasped . 
_d3610 		this is it , we made it . 
_d3610 		before the cubs could explore any farther , Zazu tracked them down . 
_d3610 		we're way beyond the boundary of the Pride lands , he said . 
_d3610 		and right now we're all in very real danger . 
_d3610 		suddenly , three hyenas slithered out of the eye sockets of an elephant skull . 
_d3610 		frightened , Simba , Zazu , and Nala jumped back . 
_d3610 		Banzai sneered , a trio of trespassers . 
_d3610 		the hyenas circled their prey , licking their chops . 
_d3610 		you know what , Sweets , can we keep that on the table ?
_d3610 
_d3610 		we don't want it to get stuck all over the rug , right ? 
_d3610 		nope . 
_d3610 		let's still read Lion king ?
_d3610 
_d3610 		(o)kay . 
_d3610 		uh , the hyenas circled their prey , licking their chops . 
_d3610 		what's the hurry , we'd love you to stick around for dinner , they said . 
_d3610 		while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom , Simba , Nala , and Zazu quickly slipped away . 
_d3610 		but the hyenas weren't distracted for long . 
_d3610 		they gave chase , and Simba and Nala had to run as fast as they could . 
_d3610 		finally , they tried hiding behind some elephant bones . 
_d3610 		just when it looked as if it was all over for the young cubs , Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with a swipe of his big paw . 
_d3610 		if you ever come near my son again , he said . 
_d3610 		the hyenas slinked away and Mufasa glared at Simba . 
_d3610 		you deliberately disobeyed me , I'm very disappointed in you . 
_d3610 		Mufasa sent Nala and Zazu home so he could talk privately to his son . 
_d3610 		Simba peered up at his father . 
_d3610 		I was just trying to be brave like you , he said . 
_d3610 		being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble , he said . 
_d3610 		Dad , we're pail , we're pals right , and we'll always be together , right ? 
_d3610 		Mufasa looked up at the stars . 
_d3610 		Simba , let me tell you something my father told me . 
_d3610 		look at the stars . 
_d3610 		the great kings of the past look down on us from those stars , so whenever you feel alone , just remember those kings will always be there to guide you , and so will I . 
_d3610 		do you remember , where did we see stars on the ceiling ? 
_d3610 		did we go to the science museum in Boston ? 
_d3610 		and we went to that planetarium ? 
_d3610 		where all the stars were all over the sky ?
_d3610 
_d3610 		wasn't that neat ? 
_d3610 		yeah . 
_d3610 		is there any Playdoh on the floor ? 
_d3610 		thank you very much . 

_d3610 		I'll be right back . 

_d3610 		o:kay . 

_d3611 		oh alrighty .
_d3611 
_d3611 		let's see . 
_d3611 		the following day , Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge . 
_d3611 		when they arrived , Scar turned to his young nephew . 
_d3611 		you wait here , your father has a marvelous surprise for you . 
_d3611 		from a distance , Mufasa noticed the rising dust . 
_d3611 		Scar appeared quickly at his side and said , stampede , in the gorge , Simba's [: Simba is] down there . 
_d3611 		without waiting a second , Mufasa took off to save his young son . 
_d3611 		Mufasa plunged into the gorge , and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests . 
_d3611 		he found Simba , grabbed him by the nape of his neck , and put him on a nearby ledge . 
_d3611 		suddenly , Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede . 
_d3611 		desperately he tried to climb up another ledge from which star Scar stood looking down on him . 
_d3611 		help me Brother , he said . 
_d3611 		Scar reached for Mufasa and pulled him close enough to whisper , long live the king . 
_d3611 		and then let go of Mufasa . 
_d3611 		ooh , gotta watch that Playdoh ! 
_d3611 		Simba peered over the ridge +//. 
_d3611 		ooh , Sweets , can you pick that up please ? 
_d3611 		uh .

_d3611 		okay . 
_d3611 		alrighty . 
_d3611 		okay which one should we read first ? 
_d3611 		Paddington . 
_d3611 		do you remember what this one's [: one is] called ? 
_d3611 		what's this one called ? 
_d3611 		Paddington's lucky day .
_d3611 
_d3611 		wow . 
_d3611 		one day not long after Paddington went to live with the Browns at number thirty two windsor gardens Mrs Brown thought she would take him out shopping . 
_d3611 		we're going to the Portobello Road explained Judy . 
_d3611 		it's a big outdoor market quite near here . 
_d3611 		you should bring your pocket money added Jonathan there's [: there is] a lot to see . 
_d3611 		do you remember that I told you that Mommy and Daddy went to Portobello Road and bought something ? 
_d3611 		do you remember what it was that we bought ?
_d3611 
_d3611 		you know the there's [: there is] a little picture above your armoire in your room ? 
_d3611 		it's a picture of a mommy and her little girl . 
_d3611 		and Daddy and I bought that at Portobello Road . 
_d3611 		yeah . 
_d3611 		before we even had you . 
_d3611 		(be)cause we knew we were gonna have a little Lily . 
_d3611 		yeah . 
_d3611 		xxx . 
_d3611 		Mommy might have_to make some tea for herself so she doesn't cough okay ? 
_d3611 		we'll finish this first though . 
_d3611 		Paddington didn't need asking twice and soon afterward they all set off . 
_d3611 		suddenly they turned a corner and Paddington found himself in what seemed like a different world . 
_d3611 		a world of outdoor stands and push+carts gold and silver ornaments books old furniture fruit vegetables people . 
_d3611 		his eyes grew larger and larger as he tried to take it all in . 
_d3611 		one store was even having its picture taken . 
_d3611 		that's a new supermarket said Judy there must be something special going on there . 
_d3611 		Paddington's mouth began to water as he peered through the glass . 
_d3611 		perhaps I could do some shopping for you Mrs Brown he asked hopefully . 
_d3611 		Mrs Brown hesitated she wasn't at all sure about letting him go off on his own quite so soon . 
_d3611 		but Jonathan told her not to worry even Paddington can't get lost in a supermarket he said . 
_d3611 		what goes in must come out . 
_d3611 		we can meet him by the checkout counter on our way back added Judy . 
_d3611 		Paddington felt most important as he entered the store . 
_d3611 		he lifted his hat to the manager who was standing just inside the door and then consulted Mrs Brown's shopping list . 
_d3611 		everywhere he looked there were shelves piled high with boxes and cans . 
_d3611 		there was even one shelf with nothing but marmalade . 
_d3611 		he could certainly see why it was called a super market . 
_d3611 		what do you like to get at the supermarket ? 
_d3611 		you like to get drinks at the supermarket ? 
_d3611 		that's true we do have_to get some drinks don't we we have_to get some juice and some milk . 
_d3611 		what else do you like to get at the supermarket ? 
_d3611 		lemonade +... 
_d3611 		excellent any food that you like to get at the supermarket ? 
_d3611 		um even more drinks wow . 
_d3611 		that's a lot of drinks . 
_d3611 		his paws were soon full and he was just beginning to wish he had left his suitcase at home when he saw the manager coming toward him pushing a large basket on wheels . 
_d3611 		may I suggest you use one of these sir he called . 
_d3611 		you can take as much as you want now he continued . 
_d3611 		can I really exclaimed Paddington . 
_d3611 		the manager nodded yes we like to make our customers happy . 
_d3611 		Paddington looked most impressed . 
_d3611 		in that case he said I think I'll have two baskets just to make sure . 
_d3611 		the more Paddington saw at the supermarket the more he liked . 
_d3611 		he felt sure Mrs Brown would be pleased when she saw all her free groceries . 
_d3611 		the other customers looked on in amazement . 
_d3611 		perhaps he's trying to win an eating prize suggested one lady . 
_d3611 		what's she wearing ? 
_d3611 		she is wearing some glasses you're right .
_d3611 
_d3611 		whoop . 
_d3611 		but the customers weren't the only ones who were watching Paddinton with interest . 
_d3611 		since he had been in the store the manager had been joined by several other important looking men . 
_d3611 		and as Paddington reached the checkout counter one of them gave a signal and they all started to clap . 
_d3611 		what do you see in his basket ? 
_d3611 		yeah wh(at) do you see anything that you recognize ? 
_d3611 		I think I see some +... 
_d3611 		right there's [: there is] some chicken over there and some +... 
_d3611 		right bananas .
_d3611 
_d3611 		and +... 
_d3611 		celery that's right that's celery .
_d3611 
_d3611 		do you know what this one is here ? 
_d3611 		that is actually looks just like lettuce that I think is cauliflower . 
_d3611 		right .
_d3611 
_d3611 		yeah .
_d3611 
_d3611 		you don't ?
_d3611 
_d3611 		Mommy likes cauliflower .
_d3611 
_d3611 		really okay .
_d3611 
_d3611 		really which cousins don't like cauliflower ?
_d3611 
_d3611 		oh they don't like cauliflower either ?
_d3611 
_d3611 		oh none of the three of you like cauliflower huh ?
_d3611 
_d3611 		well you're right Daddy doesn't like cauliflower . 
_d3611 		I think Auntie likes cauliflower . 
_d3611 		and Mommy likes cauliflower . 
_d3611 		great ! 
_d3611 		Paddington had never been to a store where they tried so hard to make their customers happy . 
_d3611 		and he gave the men a friendly wave as he unloaded his baskets . 
_d3611 		well done said the lady handing him a ticket . 
_d3611 		I hope you've brought a truck with you . 
_d3611 		there's over a hundred and fifty dollars worth here . 
_d3611 		Paddington stared at the long roll of paper in his paw . 
_d3611 		hundred and fifty dollars worth he said giving the man who had said he could take as much as he wanted one of his hardest stares . 
_d3611 		he opened his suitcase and peered inside . 
_d3611 		but I've only got a nickel . 
_d3611 		yeah .
_d3611 
_d3611 		what's he going to do ? 
_d3611 		oh no ! 
_d3611 		looking up Paddington suddenly caught sight of a crowd of people coming toward him . 
_d3611 		watch out cried the lady as he made a grab for his groceries but it was too late . 
_d3611 		with a roar like an express train everything began to tumble down off the counter . 
_d3611 		Paddington was still sitting on the floor covered with groceries when the Browns rushed into the store to see what was going on . 
_d3611 		all in all he decided he was much safer where he was for the time being . 
_d3611 		she has a surprised face I think . 
_d3611 		she's going what happened ! 
_d3611 		that's what she's saying . 
_d3611 		where's [: where is] Paddington ?
_d3611 
_d3611 		(be)cause he's hiding under all the groceries . 
_d3611 		there he is !
_d3611 
_d3611 		gr:eat ! 
_d3611 		you wouldn't think said the manager that giving someone a prize would be so difficult . 
_d3611 		a prize echoed the Browns . 
_d3611 		the manager pointed to a large notice on the wall . 
_d3611 		this young bear he said happens to be our one thousan(dth) thousandth customer today . 
_d3611 		perhaps you'd like to tell him he's [: he has] won a free supp(ly) supply of groceries ? 
_d3611 		all of which said Judy as they staggered home laden with groceries only goes to show that bears always fall on their feet . 
_d3611 		even in supermarkets agreed Jonathan . 
_d3611 		Paddington sniffed the air happily . 
_d3611 		I like the Portobello Road he said I think I shall always do my shopping here from now on . 
_d3611 		yay .
_d3611 
_d3611 		you know what Honey Mommy's [: Mommy is] just gonna make some tea okay ? 
