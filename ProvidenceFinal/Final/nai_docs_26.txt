_d5159 		I don't think the deer actually come into the strawberry patch to poop . 
_d5159 		do you have a twenty+four hour video camera ,  ? 
_d5159 		I think it was one of these things where they were right on top , they were , you know .
_d5159 		here .
_d5159 		well , it's hard to , to do it by hand .
_d5159 		why don't I use the knife ?
_d5159 		to make it easier to eat , okay ? 
_d5159 		oh .
_d5159 		oh , you got strawberry in your eye ? 
_d5159 		close your eyes for a minute and then I'll they'll feel better , if you , close them for a little +//. 
_d5159 		not not hard , just lightly .

_d5159 		I think Fancy had longer Saturday hours . 
_d5159 		you're right .
_d5159 		but this place is unknown . 
_d5159 		oh I hate  .
_d5159 		the other thing is we could go out but that involves everybody , getting ready to go out which takes too long .
_d5159 		it's a huge production .
_d5159 		I could make something but +...
_d5159 		and it's gonna be really crowded today .

_d5159 		you don't wanna do yogurt ?
_d5159 		you didn't have any yogurt . 
_d5159 		remember this , this bowl has letters on it . 
_d5159 		it's a j .
_d5160 		spells baby Bjorn . 
_d5160 		I would actually like to get , more of these bowls . 
_d5160 		and the spoons that go with em [: them] are just right too . 
_d5160 		I think they're too deep they're , too much like her bowl . 
_d5160 		the spoons . 
_d5160 		the spoons or the bowl ?
_d5160 		the spoons . 
_d5160 		the , ones that match that ?

_d5160 		they're the same , about the same as this +... 
_d5160 		there was a bird at the feeder ? 
_d5160 		what was he doing ? 
_d5160 		he was eating some seeds ?
_d5160 		how did he know that the seeds were there ? 
_d5160 		that's a good question . 
_d5160 		how did he know , that the seeds were there ? 
_d5160 		because we put them there , maybe he saw us putting them there ? 
_d5160 		that would be one way he would know . 
_d5160 		not the weeds . 
_d5160 		we planted the seeds not the weeds .
_d5160 		we want the seeds to grow not the weeds . 
_d5160 		flowers ? 
_d5160 		the weeds were flowering ? 
_d5160 		you were helping me so much when we were pulling weeds down at the garden the other day .
_d5160 		you were tugging them up , yeah .
_d5160 		you were tugging weeds ? 
_d5160 		we have lots more things to plant in our garden . 
_d5160 		beans , and I ordered some more seeds from a , kind of a rare seed place . 
_d5160 		a french pumpkin . 
_d5160 		a french pumpkin ? 
_d5160 		why ?
_d5160 		a french pumpkin . 
_d5160 		how frenchist .
_d5160 		sorry , your hair is in your yogurt on your face .
_d5160 		um , some flowers . 
_d5160 		what did I order ? 
_d5160 		I just kinda [: kind of] did it on a whim .
_d5160 		well we have beans we need to plant .
_d5160 		and Daddy has bachelor's+buttons .
_d5160 		oh yes , bachelor's+buttons ! 
_d5160 		good idea .
_d5160 		you have_to find a special place for them with Daddy . 
_d5160 		yeah . 
_d5160 		you gonna make a row for them , just like we made rows in the garden . 
_d5160 		you could do that . 
_d5160 		I would spare space if you wanted to , have them in the , vegetable garden . 
_d5160 		boy the birds are really , feeding . 
_d5160 		and they're chirping .
_d5160 		are they hungry ?
_d5160 		I think bachelor's+buttons need sun , right ?
_d5161 		or at least partial sun . 
_d5161 		you know what might be a good place ? 
_d5161 		this , area , right here , actually gets morning sun .
_d5161 		yeah , I know .
_d5161 		I don't think it does all day .
_d5161 		I know .
_d5161 		but , you could just clear out , some of whatever's there and put them . 
_d5161 		this variety is tall bachelor's+buttons .
_d5161 		yeah . 
_d5161 		see how tall they are . 
_d5161 		maybe Tuesday when it's , if maybe if it's not raining . 
_d5161 		drought tolerant .
_d5162 		in the vegetable garden ? 
_d5162 		we could plant them there , too .
_d5162 		early spring , one to two weeks before last frost so really they should , be +...
_d5162 		yeah , it's it's a perfect time . 
_d5162 		yeah . 
_d5162 		seeds require dark to germinate .
_d5162 		completely cover . 
_d5162 		mmmm .
_d5162 		some , some don't . 
_d5162 		okay , does not transplant well . 
_d5162 		two to three foot tall , that's really tall for bachelor's+buttons . 
_d5162 		huh , it'd be interesting . 
_d5162 		no , three feet is common . 
_d5162 		two to three .
_d5162 		well you see , you see them , from time to time . 
_d5162 		I've never seen bachelor's+buttons that tall .
_d5162 		mmmm . 
_d5162 		I have up to here . 
_d5162 		well , then , it's a variety for you . 
_d5162 		that'll be nice , I think that would be a good place . 
_d5162 		mmmm . 
_d5162 		would you like some toast to eat Naima ? 
_d5162 		I'll toast the toast , for you . 
_d5162 		well the toaster's [: toaster is] unplugged , that's okay . 
_d5162 		I think we don't have enough maple syrup to really make ,  +...
_d5162 		yeah we have very little , in fact , I , keep meaning to tell you . 
_d5162 		I haven't been using it so I haven't noticed .
_d5162 		I'm looking for bread so that I can make the toast for you .
_d5162 		there's bread in the freezer . 
_d5162 		yeah , I just +//. 
_d5162 		I'm not , a big , fan of bread in the freezer .
_d5162 		why am I fanning ? 
_d5162 		oh I wasn't talking about the fan .
_d5162 		she was talking about a different kind of fan . 
_d5162 		there's a different kind of fan called , a fan , somebody who likes something a lot is called a fan . 
_d5162 		that's short for fanatic . 
_d5162 		oh , what's the fan gonna blow out ?
_d5162 		fans blow air . 
_d5162 		but when people are fans we mean that they're fanatics .
_d5162 		that means they really like something a lot .
_d5162 		that means they really really really like something they're called fans . 
_d5162 		what was used to go in the house , fans ? 
_d5162 		the big fan ? 
_d5162 		upstairs in the ceiling ?
_d5162 		oh in the old house , you mean .
_d5162 		in the old house , the big noisy fan ?

_d5162 		is that what you were remembering Naima ? 
_d5162 		no ? 
_d5162 		oh .

_d5162 		but I'm making the toast .
_d5162 		I'm making the toast now .
_d5162 		I do .
_d5162 		we picked them .
_d5162 		Naima's [: Naima is] gonna help me plant them when the weather's a little bit better when it stops raining .
_d5162 		yeah it's not good to really do gardening when the ground is wet , (be)cause you spread things all over the place . 
_d5162 		yeah . 
_d5162 		we do need to tug up more weeds well maybe , who knows , maybe today it won't rain very much , and maybe it will get a little dryer and maybe we can do , things outside . 
_d5162 		well anyway I didn't finish telling you all the other kinds of seeds we're gonna plant .
_d5162 		beans , we have beans to plant .
_d5162 		we need to get some poles , to put the beans on .
_d5162 		and , we're +...
_d5162 		and we're gonna +//.
_d5162 		at the pole store ?
_d5162 		yeah , I'm gonna order some from the pole store .

_d5163 		I know .
_d5163 		there is a pole at fire+stations .
_d5163 		and you slid down the pole and , actually do you remember , when we went with Grandma  to the Museum of Science , there was a play+ground that had a pole , and you slid down that pole too ! 
_d5163 		we helped you slide down that pole . 
_d5163 		miss , little firefighter girl .

_d5164 		but wait , how could +..?
_d5164 		I mean +...
_d5164 		but , unless , it was changed it should be on the default . 
_d5164 		well +...
_d5164 		the higher speed I think gives you , greater fidelity , allegedly , I never really looked into it . 
_d5164 		I should read the manual , I suppose .

_d5165 		she's putting her own spoon in that jar so we have_to +...
