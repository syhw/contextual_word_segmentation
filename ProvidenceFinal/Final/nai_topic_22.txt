_t4 		then he went to the supermarket . 
_t4 		when he came out he got into a police car . 
_t4 		you made a good swap Daddy said Harry but pa wasn't listening and he didn't seemed to be thinking very well either , don't you agree ? 
_t4 		he is blowing a whistle and he's saying , sto:p !
_t4 		sto:p ! 
_t4 		that's (.) the pig family in a police car . 
_t4 		driving a police car . 
_t4 		who's in back of them that's a good question .
_t4 		oh the police fox is chasing them that's right .

_t4 		oh brother . 
_t4 		Roger Rhi(no) +//.
_t4 		Ma_Pig was certainly surprised to see her new ca:r . 
_t4 		there's Roger Rhino .
_t4 		I am reading the book .
_t4 		it looks as though he is very angry , that means mad . 
_t4 		with that someone who took his power shovel . 
_t4 		does he look mad to you ? 
_t4 		mmmm I think he is mad .
_t4 		they are feeling a little bit worried , I think . 
_t4 		well , let's all hope that pa pig will never again make that many mistakes in one (.) day . 
_t4 		hmmm .
_t4 		he's mad .
_t4 		he's bringing (.) the pig's car back to them , cause [: because] he wants to get his (.) steam shovel .
