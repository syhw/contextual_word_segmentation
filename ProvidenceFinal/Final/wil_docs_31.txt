_d7328 		his legs were (.) rather thin .
_d7328 
_d7328 		he was very good at standing still and munching shoots off trees . 
_d7328 		but when he tried to run around , he buckled at the knees . 
_d7328 		where every single animal turns up to skip and prance .

_d7328 		giraffes can't dance you silly fool . 
_d7328 		oh Gerald you're so weird .
_d7328 
_d7328 		Gerald simply froze up .

_d7328 		he was rooted to the spot .
_d7328 
_d7328 		they're right he thought +...
_d7328

_d7328 
_d7328 		oh I feel like such a  .
_d7328 
_d7329 		yes , you're right . 
_d7329 		so he crept off on the dance floor and he started walking home . 
_d7329 		he'd never felt so sad before and so sad and so alone . 
_d7329 		then he found a little clearing +... 
_d7329 		and he looked up at the sky . 
_d7329 		the moon can be so beautiful +... 
_d7329 		he whispered with a sigh . 
_d7329 		excuse me coughed a cricket , who'd seen Gerald early on . 
_d7329 		but sometimes when you're different , you just need a different song . 
_d7329 		listen to the swaying grass listen to the trees . 
_d7329 		to me the sweetest music is those branches in the trees .

_d7329 		and Gerald felt his body do the most amazing thing . 
_d7329 		his hooves had started shuffling making circles on the ground . 
_d7329 		his neck was gently swaying +... 
_d7329 		and then he threw his arms out sideways and he swung them everywhere . 
_d7329 		then he did a backwards somersault and leaped up in the air . 
_d7329 		Gerald felt so wonderful . 
_d7329 		his mouth was open wide .
_d7329 
_d7329 		I'm dancing yes I'm dancing . 
_d7329 		I'm dancing Gerald cried . 
_d7329 		then one by one each animal who'd been there at the dance arrived with Gerald  and watched him quite entranced .

_d7329 		they shouted it's a miracle: .
_d7329 
_d7329 		yeah it's a miracle . 

_d7329 		please Gerald tell us how .
_d7329 
_d7329 		but Gerald simply twirled around and finished with a bow . 
_d7329 		then he raised his head and looked up at the moon and stars above . 
_d7329 		we all can dance he said when we find the music that we love .

_d7330 		there was sure to be foxes in the woods or turtles in the water . 
_d7330 		and she was not going to raise a family where there might be foxes and turtles . 
_d7330 		so they flew on and on . 
_d7330 		when they got_to Boston , they felt too tired to fly any farther . 
_d7330 		there was a nice pond in the public gardens +... 
_d7330 		with a little island on it . 
_d7330 		the very place to spend the night quacked Mr Mallard . 

_d7330 		just as they were getting ready to start on their way a strange and enormous bird came by . 
_d7330 		it was pushing a boat full of people and there was a man sitting on its back . 
_d7330 		good morning quacked Mr Mallard , being polite . 
_d7330 		the big bird was too proud to answer . 
_d7330 		the people on the boat threw peanuts into the water and so the Mallards followed them all around the pond and got another breakfast . 
_d7330 		better than the first . 
_d7330 		I like this place said Mrs Mallard +... 
_d7330 		as they climbed out on the bank . 
_d7330 		and waddled along . 
_d7330 		why don't we build a nest and raise our ducklings right in this pond . 
_d7330 		there are no foxes and no turtles and the people feed us peanuts . 
_d7330 		what could be better ? 
_d7330 		good said Mr Mallard , delighted at last Mrs Mallard had found a place that suited her . 
_d7330 		but +... 
_d7330 		look out squawked Mrs Mallard . 
_d7330 		xxx . 
_d7330 		you'll get run over . 
_d7330 		and when she caught her breath she added this is no place for babies .
_d7330 
_d7330 		with all those horrid things rushing about we'll have_to look somewhere else . 
_d7330 		what's that ? 
_d7330 		it's a bicycle .
_d7330 
_d7330 		that's right . 
_d7330 		pedals . 
_d7330 		so they flew over Beacon Hill and around the State House . 
_d7330 		but there's no place there . 
_d7330 		but there was no water to swim in . 
_d7330 		then they flew over the Charles River . 
_d7330 		this is better quacked Mrs Mallard . 
_d7330 		xxx looks like (.) quite (.) like a nice quiet place . 
_d7330 		it's only a little away from the public garden . 
_d7330 		yes said Mrs Mallard , remembering the peanuts . 
_d7330 		that looks just (.) that looks like just the right place to hatch ducklings . 
_d7330 		so they chose a cozy spot on one of the bushes near the water and settled down to build their nest . 
_d7330 		and only just in time for now they were beginning to  . 
_d7330 		all their old wing feathers start to drop out . 
_d7330 		and would not be able to fly again until the new ones grew in . 
_d7330 		but of course they could swim and one day they swam over to the park on the river  and there they met a policeman called Michael . 
_d7330 		Michael fed them peanuts . 
_d7330 		and after that the Mallards called upon Michael every day . 
_d7330 		yeah .
_d7330 
_d7330 		after Mrs Mallard had laid eight eggs in the nest she couldn't go visit Michael anymore . 
_d7330 		(be)cause she had to sit on the eggs to keep them warm . 
_d7330 		she moved off the nest only to get a drink of water or to have her lunch or to count the eggs and make sure they were all there . 
_d7330 		one day the ducklings hatched out . 
_d7330 		first came Jack , then Pack , then Lack , then Mack , and Nack , and Wack , and Pack , and Quack .
_d7330 
_d7330 		Mr and Mrs Mallard were bursting with pride . 
_d7330 		it's a great responsibility taking care of so many ducklings and they kept them very busy . 
_d7330 		yeah there's a mommy . 

_d7358 
_d7358 		when it came time to dance (.) he was really very bad . 
_d7358 		the wart+hog started waltzing , and the rhinos rock and rolled +... 
_d7358 		the lions danced the tango that was elegant and bold . 
_d7358 		the chimps all did a cha+cha with a very latin  +//.
_d7358 
_d7358 		they're doing cha+cha , that's right +//.
_d7358 
_d7358 		and eight baboons then teamed up for a splendid Scottish  . 
_d7358 		Gerald swallowed +//.

_d7358 
_d7358 		no , they're not doing dancing , no they're watching . 
_d7358 		but the lion saw him coming and they soon began to roar . 
_d7358 		hey , look at clumsy Gerald , the animals all sneered +... 
_d7358 		giraffes can't dance you silly fool ,  Gerald you're so weird . 
_d7358 		Gerald simply froze up ,  he was rooted to the spot . 
_d7358 		so he crept off from the dance floor and he started walking home . 
_d7358 		he'd never felt so sad before , so sad and all alone . 
_d7358 		then he found a little clearing and he looked up at the sky +... 
_d7358 		the moon can be so beautiful , he whispered with a sigh . 
_d7358 		excuse me , coughed a cricket who'd [: who had] seen Gerald earlier on . 
_d7358 		but sometimes when you're different , you just need a different song . 
_d7358 		listen to the swaying grass , and listen to the trees +... 
_d7358 		to me the sweetest music is those branches in the breeze . 
_d7358 		so imagine that the lovely moon is playing just for you .

_d7358 		yeah what , listen +//.
_d7358 
_d7358 		the violin , that's right +//. 
_d7358 		with that the cricket smiled , and picked up his violin . 
_d7358 		then Gerald felt his body do the most amazing thing .
_d7358 
_d7358 		that's right . 
_d7358 		his hooves had started shuffling ,  making circles on the ground . 
_d7358 		his neck was gently swaying , and his tail was swishing (a)round . 
_d7358 		he threw his arms out sideways , and he swung them everywhere . 
_d7358 		then he did a backwards somersault , and leapt up in the air . 
_d7358 		Gerald felt so wonderful , his mouth was open wide +... 
_d7358 		I'm dancing , yes I'm dancing , I'm dancing , Gerald cried . 
_d7358 		then one by one each animal who'd [: who had] been there at the dance +... 
_d7358 		arrived while Gerald boogied on +//.
_d7358 
_d7358 		and watched him , quite entranced . 
_d7358 		they shouted , it's a miracle , we must be in a dream ! 

_d7358 		how did you learn how to dance like that , please Gerald , tell us how ? 
_d7358 		but Gerald simply twirled around and finished with a bow . 
_d7358 		and he raised his head and looked up at the moon and stars above . 
_d7358 		we all can dance , he said , when we find music that we love . 
