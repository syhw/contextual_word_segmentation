_d5232 		remember  who used to be there , the librarian ? 
_d5232 		do you remember her ? 
_d5232 		she used to sing welcome welcome everyone , now you're here we'll have some fun ! 
_d5232 		xxx used to be in that story group . 
_d5232 		library group . 
_d5232 		remember that ? 
_d5232 		yeah , when you were a littler , but you weren't really , well you were a baby when you started +... 
_d5232 		but then you were a little toddler when we still used to go there . 
_d5232 		you used to do trot+trot to Boston , trot+trot to  , you better watch out or you might fall in ! 
_d5232 		remember doing that ? 
_d5232 		at the library .
_d5232 		and you used to do it with  sometimes too . 
_d5232 		let's see +...

_d5232 		when you were a bigger toddler ? 
_d5232 		or when you were a little toddler ? 
_d5232 		you're a big toddler now . 
_d5232 		well +... 
_d5232 		you did go to a toddler group after we stopped going to that library group . 
_d5232 		where Jane used to come and read stories and then there was a craft . 
_d5232 		you did that a couple of times . 
_d5232 		there were a lot of children there , do you remember ? 
_d5232 		I don't remember , we only went to that twice I think . 
_d5232 		so I didn't really learn their names . 
_d5232 		if we have time we could go to the South Yarmouth Library after our play group and see if they have the Bear Family book and check it out . 
_d5232 		would you like to do that ? 
_d5232 		I thought so . 
_d5232 		is Waldo the Grandpa bear ? 
_d5232 		maybe you're right . 
_d5232 		I thought he was , I thought he was Uncle Waldo . 
_d5232 		you want some more grape ? 
_d5232 		with a towel ? 
_d5232 		do you think bears use towels ? 
_d5232 		I think they might just shake themselves off likes dogs do . 
_d5232 		(be)cause it's easier than having to have a towel . 
_d5232 		they do what ? 
_d5232 		what do bears do ? 
_d5232 		bear potties ? 
_d5232 		bear parties ?

_d5232 		and the baby bear poops in the forest too . 
_d5232 		or in the meadow . 
_d5232 		(be)cause animals don't +...
_d5232 		animals don't use potties , except cats who live in the house use  cat potties . 
_d5232 		yup [: yes] . 
_d5232 		umm I don't think that animals do , that's a rule for people . 
_d5232 		that they need to wash their hands when they poop or pee . 
_d5232 		after they poop or pee . 
_d5232 		well animals don't usually do that , although cats and some animals do clean themselves up after they poop or pee in the potty . 
_d5232 		I am looking for +... 
_d5232 		oh there's pictures of pee+pee and poop in that , animal pee+pee and poop . 
_d5232 		well you tell me , what do oops +...

_d5232 		do you wanna try hanging up the dolls clothes with the clothes+pins ?

_d5232 		yes . 
_d5232 		green green buckets of garbage .

_d5232 		he's very strong . 
_d5232 		bye+bye garbage truck !

_d5232 		the truck takes the garbage to the dump . 
_d5232 		okay . 
_d5232 		there's water in the dump+truck ? 
_d5232 		oh , you're talking about your toy dump+truck ? 
_d5232 		the twine is right here . 
_d5232 		and I'm going to put the clothes+line for the doll clothes right here . 
_d5232 		yup [: yes] , and we have_to clean the toys up so that you can stand there and hang those . 
_d5232 		clothes with the clothes+pins . 
_d5232 		I'm gonna help you do that . 
_d5232 		in just a second . 
_d5232 		oh let's clean them up in a nice neat way though , okay ? 
_d5232 		I don't want just everything dumped in the living room , ouch ! 
_d5232 		(be)cause I hit my foot , that's why . 
_d5232 		yes , thank you . 
_d5232 		you're right . 
_d5232 		I do like a nice neat room ,  I see what you're doing ! 
_d5232 		you're straightening up . 
_d5232 		for Daddy to stand ? 
_d5232 		for you to stand . 
_d5232 		where is , yeah . 
_d5232 		now the other thing we need to do is to find the  +... 
_d5232 		doll clothes . 
_d5232 		why don't you put these things  +... 
_d5232 		over where the +... 
_d5232 		here this too . 
_d5232 		where the tool box is . 
_d5232 		that's where those things belong . 
_d5232 		they belong with the tool+box . 
_d5232 		well , we're straightening up so that you have room . 
_d5232 		to put the +... 
_d5232 		doll clothes .
_d5232 		hanging up there with the +...
_d5232 		yeah . 
_d5232 		can you just , why don't you practice by just putting a clothes+pin on that line . 
_d5232 		can you do that ? 
_d5232 		do it the same way you do it on the box , you have_to hold the top of the clothes+pin . 
_d5232 		push . 
_d5232 		and then clip . 
_d5232 		can I show you ? 
_d5232 		okay watch my fingers , push ! 
_d5232 		there yeah , and it hangs upside down like that .
_d5232 		okay , the way you take it off +... 
_d5232 		push ! 
_d5232 		and there . 
_d5232 		okay , what +...
_d5232 		find the doll clothes , you need to find them before you hang them up . 
_d5232 		here's something to hang up . 
_d5232 		where are the rest of the doll clothes ? 
_d5232 		for hanging up . 
_d5232 		seems to me you need to find some more . 
_d5232 		okay , this is what we're gonna do . 
_d5232 		put it here and now you can push . 
_d5232 		just like you did it on the box the same way , but you have_to point it down . 
_d5232 		it's upside down . 
_d5232 		okay watch Mommy do it . 
_d5232 		push . 
_d5232 		and clip . 
_d5232 		and this is gonna move but that's okay . 
_d5232 		it doesn't matter . 
_d5232 		you need to use words to say what you want .
_d5232 		put it up right ? 
_d5232 		it doesn't matter .
_d5232 		we can't put it up right because the twine is too small . 
_d5232 		if it were thicker twine then it would stay up right I think . 
_d5232 		oh yeah ? 
_d5232 		do you wanna get some more doll clothes and hang them up to dry ? 
_d5232 		why don't you look in your room and see if there's some in there ? 
_d5232 		hey look what I found under the lego table ! 
_d5232 		okay . 
_d5232 		this is tricky , you gotta hold that with one hand . 
_d5232 		and hold the clothes+pin with your other hand . 
_d5232 		want me to hold the clothes up for you ? 
_d5232 		yeah , you were doing a good job . 
_d5232 		okay . 
_d5232 		push a little more on the top of the clothes+pin . 
_d5232 		you wanna do it on the floor ? 
_d5232 		you know you can hang the clothes up right on the box where you've been putting the clothes+pins . 
_d5232 		take the clothes over to the box . 
_d5232 		let me have it . 
_d5232 		I wanna show you . 
_d5232 		I wanna show you .
_d5232 		you don't want me to show you ? 
_d5232 		oh okay . 
_d5232 		I could show you and then you could try it after I do it . 
_d5232 		that's how you learn things . 
_d5232 		you watch someone do it .
_d5232 		oh .
_d5232 		I see . 
_d5232 		what happened ? 
_d5232 		what happened ?

_d5232 		do you want some frozen +... 
_d5232 		cherries ? 
_d5232 		yeah ?
_d5232 		are you feeling upset ? 
_d5232 		why don't you have a bottle of milk or something ? 
_d5232 		you want a bottle of cow's milk ? 
_d5232 		grape juice ? 
_d5232 		apple juice ? 
_d5232 		uhh cookie ? 
_d5232 		alphabet cookie ? 
_d5232 		frozen banana ? 
_d5232 		you could have frozen banana . 
_d5232 		nursies want to rest . 
_d5232 		why don't you  pick out something from the fridge that you want ?
_d5232 		there's baby yogurt .
_d5232 		how (a)bout count to ten nursie ?

_d5232 		I think a little food would be a good idea . 
_d5232 		it willn't [= won't] , it won't be good ? 
_d5232 		oh all+right , you want me to read that while you're eating and drinking ? 
_d5232 		we could do that . 
_d5232 		yes+y ?

_d5232 		it is . 
_d5232 		we need to buy more smoothie , remember we went to the store yesterday and they didn't have the right kind of smoothie ! 
_d5232 		they just didn't . 
_d5232 		that store doesn't carry that kind of smoothie , I was very disappointed . 
_d5232 		yeah , there is a picture of a cow right there . 
_d5232 		bah ?
_d5232 		that's what cows say ? 
_d5232 		bah and gah ? 
_d5232 		are you sure that's what cows say ? 
_d5232 		really ? 
_d5232 		I don't think so . 
_d5232 		they don't ? 
_d5232 		cows say bah , that's a good joke ! 
_d5232 		oh , that's not a joke ?
_d5232 		oh .
_d5233 		snow sled ? 
_d5233 		quite a long time ago ? 
_d5233 		that one ?
_d5233 		oh . 
_d5233 		yeah , we did buy a snow sled at the toy store . 
_d5233 		that was a long time ago . 
_d5233 		who wants to play in the snow with that ? 
_d5233 		well if it snows I'll definitely give you that to play with . 
_d5234 		smoothie_c . 
_d5234 		let's put it in here . 
_d5234 		you want a paper cup ? 
_d5234 		all+right . 
_d5234 		you better use both hands . 
_d5234 		are you gonna have the hummus too ? 
_d5234 		it's Mommy Day today ? 
_d5234 		I didn't know it was Mommy Day . 
_d5234 		use both hands with that . 
_d5234 		Mommy Day ? 
_d5234 		hmmm . 
_d5234 		do you wanna [: want a] little cracker with your hummus or are you just gonna just use the spoon ? 
_d5234 		okay I think , you wanna try this kinda [: kind of] cracker ? 
_d5234 		with sesame seeds on it . 
_d5234 		mmmm . 
_d5234 		crunchy and good . 
_d5234 		Akmak . 
_d5234 		that's the kinda [: kind of] crackers they are . 
_d5234 		Akmak . 
_d5234 		Akmak . 
_d5234 		oh , I heard a birdie ! 
_d5234 		I thought it was a vulture ? 
_d5234 		actually , I didn't think that was a vulture . 
_d5234 		it doesn't sound like a vulture , I'm gonna drink some orange juice . 
_d5234 		while you're having your snack . 
_d5234 		yeah .
_d5234 		yeah , (be)cause I'm thirsty . 
_d5234 		that's exactly what I was doing ! 
_d5234 		how did you know that ? 
_d5235 		umm , what does the police+man say to Corduroy ? 
_d5235 		he says how did you get up here ? 
_d5235 		why does he say that ? 
_d5235 		yeah , Corduroy went up the escalator all by himself ! 
_d5235 		that's very strange for a little bear to do that all by himself . 
_d5235 		or herself .
_d5235 		(be)cause bears don't usually walk around department stores all by themselves after dark . 
_d5235 		they might get lost ! 
_d5235 		he did get a little bit lost , didn't he ? 
_d5235 		yes .
_d5235 		he was trying to look for the button . 
_d5235 		well +...
_d5235 umm 
_d5235  because he knows that the people who are in the store who want to buy a little bear he hears them say that they want bears who don't have lost buttons 
_d5235  they want bears who already have their buttons . 
_d5235 		let's see here +... 
_d5235 		wow , you polished that right up didn't you ? 
_d5235 		hungry girl ! 
_d5235 		here's a bit more ! 
_d5235 		oh boy ! 
_d5235 		you like that , huh ? 
_d5235 		that's how the akh makh is made . 
_d5235 		it's made with sesame seeds on it . 
_d5235 		that's just how it's made . 
_d5235 		did you have fun this morning ? 
_d5235 		where did we go ? 
_d5235 		do you remember ? 
_d5235 		whose house did we go to ? 
_d5235 		xxx house . 
_d5235 		that was fun . 
_d5235 		and you wanted to see what his high+chair looked like . 
_d5235 		and you saw it . 
_d5235 		looks like a restaurant high+chair , doesn't it ? 
_d5235 		it looks the same kinda [: kind of] restaurant ,  high+chair that restaurants usually use . 
_d5235 		well he has one that's like a restaurant high+chair , but he uses it at home . 
_d5235 		what did you say ? 
_d5235 		you're interesting ? 
_d5235 		mmmm+hmmm .
_d5235 		what are they called , do you remember ?
_d5235 		akh makh , yes . 
_d5235 		more smoothie ? 
_d5235 		smoothie_c . 
_d5235 		smoothie_c . 
_d5235 		you're helping me , okay . 
_d5235 		you've never seen what ? 
_d5235 		you've never seen a Mommy duckling kissing her mommy duck ? 
_d5235 		you've never seen a duckling hug her Mommy . 
_d5235 		why ? 
_d5236 		what do ducks eat ? 
_d5236 		I think they eat little plants that grow in the water . 
_d5236 		mostly . 
_d5236 		I dunno [: don't know] if ducks eat insects , I'd like to find out . 
_d5236 		I think we should find out . 
_d5236 		maybe I'll write that , we have a list of questions on the board . 
_d5236 		and one would be do ducks , what do ducks eat ? 
_d5236 		that's a very good question . 
_d5236 		I will write it down on our question sheet right now . 
_d5236 		our list of questions . 
_d5236 		what do ducks eat ? 
_d5236 		I dunno [: don't know] , I'm gonna find out for you . 
_d5237 		they live near the water . 
_d5237 		I think they drink water from ponds , or lakes or +... 
_d5237 		rivers .
_d5237 		oh . 
_d5237 		just from lakes . 
_d5237 		I think we should go to Cape Cod Natural Foods . 
_d5237 		when you're done with your snack .
_d5237 		so that we can buy more smoothie . 
_d5237 		because +... 
_d5237 		(be)cause +... 
_d5237 		we're out , almost out of smoothie . 
_d5237 		you're about to , you're about to finish . 
_d5237 		the last smoothie . 
_d5237 		and we also need some +... 
_d5237 		uhh canola oil . 
_d5237 		and fish sticks . 
_d5237 		yeah . 
_d5237 		you wanna eat , drink some more ? 
_d5237 		there's a little bit left . 
_d5237 		let's see +... 
_d5237 		yeah , okay . 
_d5237 		that's the end of it though . 
_d5237 		all gone . 
_d5237 		it's all gone ! 
_d5237 		well , how (a)bout drinking more smoothie ? 
_d5237 		I heard you say that . 
_d5237 		but  a smoothie is for drinking , not for washing . 
_d5237 		it just is . 
_d5238 		okay , Mommy's gonna make chili tonight . 
_d5238 		to eat , chili is a food we eat , it's spicy beans . 
_d5238 		yeah ?
_d5238 		what ? 
_d5238 		you're a silly+willy ? 
_d5238 		who's a silly+willy ? 
_d5238 		mmmm+hmmm , I'm cutting . 
_d5238 		hot peppers here . 
_d5238 		I'm gonna freeze these hot peppers . 
_d5238 		to use later , or maybe I'll +... 
_d5238 		use a little more of them now . 
_d5238 		I'm cutting those hot peppers . 
_d5238 		well , they're very very hot and spicy so I don't wanna +... 
_d5238 		cause you to sneeze excessively . 
_d5238 		there we go . 
_d5238 		we're gonna put these in the freezer . 
_d5238 		say excuse me . 
_d5238 		yeah . 
_d5238 		excuse me . 
_d5238 		it's empty . 
_d5238 		okay . 
_d5238 		no smoothie in there . 
_d5238 		there is ? 
_d5238 		I thought it was all gone . 
_d5238 		dripping it . 
_d5238 		no smoothie_c . 
_d5238 		you still eating your hummus or are you finished with it ? 
_d5238 		oh , okay . 
_d5238 		what is that cracker called ? 
_d5238 		remember ? 
_d5239 		well , I am still drinking it . 
_d5239 		(be)cause it's thirsty , I'm thirsty . 
_d5239 		and I +... 
_d5239 		wanna keep healthy . 
_d5239 		I'm not eating anything right now . 
_d5239 		I'm just drinking orange juice . 
_d5239 		there's no Daddy down+stairs . 
_d5239 		you know where he is and what he's doing I think . 
_d5239 		yeah . 
_d5239 		he's gonna help people feel better . 
_d5239 		patients . 
_d5239 		what do you think ? 
_d5239 		you know the answer to that question . 
_d5239 		he's gonna check their hearts , oops . 
_d5239 		well , I just realized that your bib and your microphone fell down . 
_d5239 		some time ago , perhaps . 
_d5239 		there . 
_d5239 		he's gonna listen to their hearts with a stethoscope . 
_d5239 		what else does he do to help them feel better Naima ? 
_d5239 		he looks in their ears with an otoscope ? 
_d5239 		I don't think he does that a lot , but I think once in a while maybe he does that . 
_d5239 		he figures out what kind of medicine they need . 
_d5239 		I'm cooking onions and garlic . 
_d5239 		and green hot spicy peppers . 
_d5239 		(be)cause I'm making chili . 
_d5239 		and chili's also gonna have black+beans in it . 
_d5239 		and tomatoes . 
_d5239 		and we're gonna eat it for supper later on . 
_d5239 		you'll have chili . 
_d5239 		well right now it's just onions , it's not that interesting . 
_d5239 		but +... 
_d5239 		when it's all cooking everything's in it you can have a look at it . 
_d5239 		your hand's [: hand is] going away ? 
_d5239 		oh , it's very dark outside isn't it ? 
_d5239 		I think it's overcast .
_d5239 		you think it's gonna snow or rain ? 
_d5239 		it doesn't really snow in the summer . 
_d5239 		just summer is not a time when there's snow . 
_d5239 		winter , fall and spring are the only time when it snows . 
_d5239 		uhh  house . 
_d5239 		what was he doing there ? 
_d5239 		he was actually , he was giving you little hugs . 
_d5239 		he wanted to touch you and give you hugs . 
_d5239 		and he actually give you a kiss on your back , he's a very sneaky kisser . 
_d5239 		he likes to sneak up behind people and kiss them on the back of their head . 
_d5239 		well he's little . 
_d5239 		he's a little bit shy , I think +... 
_d5240 		oh ,  . 
_d5240 		it does fit ? 
_d5240 		no .
_d5240 		what's not working ? 
_d5240 		oh .
