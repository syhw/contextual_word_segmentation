_d2154 		driver tells me it may be dangerous up there , careful Toby ! 
_d2154 		I'll try , said Toby bravely . 
_d2154 		Percy watched anxiously as Toby trundled away . 
_d2154 		there he goes , over that bridge . 
_d2154 		his journey took him over a wooden bridge at the edge of the village .

_d2154 		the dam did not look safe at all , and Toby was worried . 
_d2154 		soon , he knew why .
_d2154 
_d2154 		it broke . 
_d2154 		see , the wall broke .
_d2154 
_d2154 		the dam's breaking up ! 
_d2154 		we must warn everyone !
_d2154 
_d2154 		Toby shunted back as fast as his wheels would let him . 
_d2154 		Percy was waiting anxiously for Toby by the bridge .
_d2154 
_d2154 		the river had risen so high that the bridge was in danger of collapsing . 
_d2154 		the dam's breaking up , we must find high ground ! 
_d2154 		your only chance is to cross the bridge , called Toby . 
_d2154 		called Percy . 
_d2154 		it doesn't look safe to me , wailed Toby .
_d2154 
_d2154 		yeah .
_d2154 
_d2154 		Thomas , look at it break up like that , an(d) the water's rushing through . 

_d2154 		we'll follow him on our line . 
_d2154 		it meets the river further down .
_d2154 
_d2154 		as Toby floated helplessly in the floodwaters , they passed a sign that made them shudder . 
_d2154 		what does it say ? 
_d2154 		beware the waterfall , that's right .
_d2154 
_d2154 		if we go over that waterfall , we're +... 
_d2154 		doomed ,  .

_d2154 		okay .
_d2154 
_d2154 		you're a tired little pumpkin today , huh ? 
_d2154 		let's see . 
_d2154 		we're gonna drop a rope to you .
_d2154 
_d2154 		attach it to yourself .
_d2154 
_d2154 		quickly , now .
_d2154 
_d2154 		and they did . 
_d2154 		to one of Toby's buffers .
_d2154 
_d2154 		just then , Percy arrived . 
_d2154 		Harold flew over to him . 
_d2154 		catch the rope and pull Toby to safety ! 
_d2154 		he called . 
_d2154 		Toby was safe at last .

_d2154 		Percy's pulling Toby .
_d2154 
_d2154 		an(d) he's attached to a rope . 
_d2154 		when the floods were over and the dam mended , the villagers had a big party for Toby , hosted by Sir Topham Hatt . 
_d2154 		you were very brave , Toby . 
_d2154 		thanks to Harold !
_d2154 
_d2154 		I never could've been so brave , Toby , said Percy .
_d2154 
_d2154 		oh , I'm sure you would be . 
_d2154 		but you never know (un)til you've tried .
_d2154 
_d2154 		Percy rather hoped he would never have_to ! 
_d2154 		what story's this ? 
_d2154 		a better view for Gordon , that's right .
_d2154 
_d2154 		Gordon was feeling grumpy . 
_d2154 		this was making James cross .
_d2154 
_d2154 		why are you complaining all the time ? 
_d2154 		because I'm a big engine and I know everything . 
_d2154 		I shall complain whenever I want . 
_d2154 		you're just a small engine with ideas above your station .
_d2154 
_d2154 		I can't see any , said Percy , where are they ? 
_d2154 		any what ? 
_d2154 		ideas , above the station .
_d2154 
_d2154 		the sky's empty .
_d2154 
_d2154 		like your smoke+box , Percy ! 
_d2154 		laughed James . 
_d2154 		but Gordon was still grumpy !
_d2154 
_d2154 		one day I'll show you just what a big engine can really do . 
_d2154 		not speak to silly little green +//. 
_d2154 		so what can a big engine really do ?
_d2154 
_d2154 		not speak to silly little green engines , for a start , replied Gordon .
_d2154 
_d2154 		then he puffed away . 
_d2154 		later that day , Sir Topham Hatt came to see him . 
_d2154 		Gordon , you'll be making one stop today , with an empty express , to test our new station . 
_d2154 		you can make up time afterwards . 
_d2154 		why can't Henry do it ? 
_d2154 		he likes idling in stations .
_d2154 
_d2154 		you will do as you are told . 
_d2154 		so Gordon did , but he was still unhappy . 
_d2154 		an(d) he grew sick , too ! 
_d2154 		Gordon was sick ! 
_d2154 		mmmm , can you see his face ?
_d2154 
_d2154 		there it is .
_d2154 
_d2154 		he's making a funny face . 
_d2154 		mmmm .
_d2154 
_d2154 		I can't do it ,  . 
_d2154 		do I look like Gordon ? 
_d2154 		xxx , you look funny too ! 
_d2154 		I just can't get up to speed , he moaned . 
_d2154 		it's time for your visit to the works .
_d2154 
_d2154 		he moaned , and he groaned .
_d2154 
_d2154 		your pipes are clogged , said the fireman . 
_d2154 		at last , they approached the new station . 
_d2154 		Gordon was impressed , but his mood soon changed . 
_d2154 		in front of him was a blank wall an(d) huge buffers . 
_d2154 		what a boring view ! 
_d2154 		important engines like me should have a panoramic view , where I can see people and people can see me . 
_d2154 		weesh !
_d2154 
_d2154 		weesh ! 
_d2154 		Gordon was happy when it was time to leave . 
_d2154 		now you can really enjoy your run , as long as your pipes will let you , said his driver . 
_d2154 		come on , come on , I can go faster than this , puffed Gordon . 
_d2154 		sick ? 
_d2154 		me ?
_d2154 
_d2154 		never .
_d2154 
_d2154 		but Gordon began to feel more and more feeble . 
_d2154 		that means weak . 
_d2154 		soon , he came to a complete stop .
_d2154 
_d2154 		what happened ? 
_d2154 		his driver and his fireman inspected him . 
_d2154 		something's broken inside you , said the fireman .
_d2154 
_d2154 		now you really will have_to go to the works . 
_d2154 		Gordon was still angry when James arrived to collect his cookies . 
_d2154 		well , well , well ! 
_d2154 		so much for knowing about everything !
_d2154 
_d2154 		you got too puffed up in your boiler , so it serves you right . 
_d2154 		serves you right , serves you right ! 
_d2154 		when Gordon returned from the works a few days later , he was still boasting . 
_d2154 		probably the finest in the world ! 
_d2154 		come on , Gordon , we're going to the new official opening of the station . 
_d2154 		then there was trouble ! 
_d2154 		as Gordon approached the station . 
_d2154 		neither the fire +//.
_d2154 
_d2154 		driver or the fireman could apply his brakes .
_d2154 
_d2154 		something had jammed !
_d2154 
_d2154 		the driver reduced steam , but Gordon was still going too fast ! 
_d2154 		help me , please ! 
_d2154 		he pleaded to him .
_d2154 
_d2154 		well , Gordon , said Sir Topham Hatt , I knew you wanted a panoramic view , but this is not the way to achieve it . 
_d2154 		what did Gordon say ? 
_d2154 		yes , so sorry , sir !
_d2154 
_d2154 		yes so sorry sir !
_d2154 
_d2154 		when Gordon was repaired again , he took Sir Topham Hatt to the new station for its second official opening . 
_d2154 		this time he arrived safely , an(d) everyone clapped and cheered as he pulled in . 
