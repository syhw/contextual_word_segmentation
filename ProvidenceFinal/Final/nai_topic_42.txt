_t4 		it's about an oil spill . 
_t4 		do you wanna sit in the bed and read that together ? 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		well there's a certain kind of oil spill that happens (.) when oil being carried , lots a big amount of oil being carried by a boat ,  has an accident and spills out accidentally . 
_t4 		and that causes problems for animals , when that happens . 
_t4 		oh , and we haven't read that , called Snowy Owl . 
_t4 		is that a beaver or an otter ? 
_t4 		oh , I wanna read this and find out .
_t4 		mmmm , that's a problem . 
_t4 		poor little otter . 
_t4 		well , we're gonna read about that . 
_t4 		right now .
_t4 		xxx into the bed and do some reading , unless you wanna read in the rocking chair . 
_t4 		so many good books .
_t4 		Naima , I'll be right back . 
_t4 		I just wanna get these things out of the way .
_t4 		well , oil spills aren't good for animals . 
_t4 		all kinds of problems +... 
_t4 		no . 
_t4 		people can't be swimming in the water when there's an oil spill . 
_t4 		you'd get sick from that . 
_t4 		cause it's not good to swim where there's +... 
_t4 		you know , that's not like the oil we cook with .
_t4 		that's oil that is used to put into cars and gasoline .
_t4 		crude oil , it turns into that kind of oil .
_t4 		come sit here next to me . 
_t4 		get comfy . 
_t4 		have a seat . 
_t4 		well , it lives there .
_t4 		but let's [: let us] find out what it , where it lives and what it's doing and what happens to it . 
_t4 		this is called Oil Spill . 
_t4 		I'm not even sure what kind of animal that is . 
_t4 		yeah I guess I think it's an otter .
_t4 mmmm oil spills happen when big 
_t4  big 
_t4  big boats like this that are carrying crude 
_t4  it's called crude 
_t4  oil from one country to another have an accident of some kind and they spill their oil into the ocean . 
_t4 		that doesn't happen very often , but when it happens , it's not a good thing . 
_t4 		okay , and this is actually the story of an oil spill that really happened a while ago . 
_t4 		the night of March twenty+fourth , nineteen+eighty+nine , was dark and cold . 
_t4 		this is how big that boat is .
_t4 		a huge black oil tanker glided out of the port of Valdez , Alaska . 
_t4 		painted on its bow was its name , exxon+valdez . 
_t4 		the bow of the boat is this part , kind+of like the front . 
_t4 		the exxon+valdez floated low in the water . 
_t4 		about fifty million gallons of crude oil weighed it down .
_t4 		the huge tanker slowly sailed out into Prince William Sound . 
_t4 		and then , suddenly , it happened . 
_t4 		crunch .
_t4 		the ship slammed into an underwater reef .
_t4 		it poured into the dark water . 
_t4 		the exxon+valdez spilled out , out eleven million gallons of oil . 
_t4 		that much oil could fill over a thousand big swimming pools .
_t4 		this is a picture of Alaska , Naima . 
_t4 		this is a map of Alaska right here . 
_t4 		this is where that oil spill happened , this part of Alaska . 
_t4 		are you cold ? 
_t4 		you're uncomfortable ? 
_t4 		the sticky oil soon covered eleven thousand square miles of ocean water . 
_t4 		okay , let's skip ahead and see +//. 
_t4 		oil stuck to the feathers of many ducks , geese , and sea birds .
_t4 		the birds couldn't swim or fly . 
_t4 		some of them died . 
_t4 		oil got into the bodies of fish , shrimp , and crabs . 
_t4 		no one knows how many of them were killed . 
_t4 		mmmm , the oil is hurting the animals .
_t4 		sea otters , sea+lions , harbor+seals , and killer+whales swallowed oil . 
_t4 		that's a whale .
_t4 		they breathed the poisonous fumes . 
_t4 		these animals got very sick also . 
_t4 		hey , that's a (.) sea+lion I think . 
_t4 		do you remember we saw sea lions ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 		because it spilled out of the boat . 
_t4 		oil spills have many causes . 
_t4 		some are accidents . 
_t4 		like a tanker like the exxon+valdez runs aground , or collides with another ship . 
_t4 		that means bumps into another ship .
_t4 		workers can make mistakes . 
_t4 		or an under+sea oil well starts to lea(k) , leak . 
_t4 		or a pipe can break . 
_t4 		the oil spreads out . 
_t4 		it floats on top of the water . 
_t4 		experts on oil spills rush to the scene . 
_t4 		they start to clean up the mess .
_t4 		the first job is to stop the oil from spreading . 
_t4 		they put a boom around the spill . 
_t4 		the boom is like a collar .
_t4 		it keeps the oil in one place . 
_t4 		you see this red thing here ?
_t4 		this is the boom . 
_t4 		it's usually made out of different things . 
_t4 		for small spills , the experts may call for a skimmer . 
_t4 		there are several kinds of skimmers . 
_t4 		one type works like a giant vacuum+cleaner .
_t4 		it sucks up the oil from the water . 
_t4 		sometimes the oil the skimmer collects can be used again . 
_t4 		for some small spills , experts place special pads on top of the oil . 
_t4 		the pads are like sponges . 
_t4 		they soak up the oil , then they have_to get rid of the soaked up oil . 
_t4 		for larger spills , the experts may set the oil on fire . 
_t4 		clean up crews also use chemicals to get rid of large oil spills . 
_t4 		other chemicals make the oil come together . 
_t4 		the oil forms a layer like a sheet of rubber . 
_t4 		one type of skimmer , I guess this is the skimmer machine , lifts the sheet of oil and oily debris , that means garbage , out of the water . 
_t4 		oh , what kind of animals are these ? 
_t4 		puffins ! 
_t4 		sometimes , the experts decide that no action is the best way to treat an oil spill . 
_t4 		the wind and waves mix the oil and water together . 
_t4 		it is like mixing oil and vinegar to make salad dressing ! 
_t4 		in time , much of the oil disappears . 
_t4 		oil spills are major disasters . 
_t4 		it's a very bad thing that happens , that's what a disaster is .
_t4 		slowly , scientists are learning how to clean them up . 
_t4 		they are learning how to prevent spills . 
_t4 		how can we help to prevent oil spills ? 
_t4 		that's a good question . 
_t4 		well , we can use less oil .
_t4 		if we use less oil , there will be fewer oil tankers in the oceans . 
_t4 		then the chance of oil spills will not be as great . 
_t4 		one way +//. 
_t4 		I bet you didn't know this , Naima .
_t4 		you might be surprised .
_t4 		one way to save oil is to use less (.) electricity ! 
_t4 		did you know that oil and electricity are related ? 
_t4 		electricity is often produced by burning oil . 
_t4 		less electricity means less oil and less risk of an oil spill . 
_t4 		because sometimes power plants burn oil to make electricity that comes through the electric lines into our house . 
_t4 		another way to cut oil needs is to use less gasoline , which is made from oil . 
_t4 		gasoline is made from oil . 
_t4 		that means driving smaller cars and staying within the speed limit . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		oh , there's a child who wrote a letter to someone in the government . 
_t4 		and drew pictures of sea animals . 
_t4 		wow , and look at the other books in this series . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] see , this is a stage two book . 
_t4 		this book is called Be A Friend to Trees . 
_t4 		this book is called Dinosaurs Are Different . 
_t4 		this book is called Where Does the Garbage Go . 
_t4 		that would be a good book to get . 
_t4 		that's called The Planets in Our Solar System . 
_t4 		hmmm .
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		trees are good for the earth and good for people and good for animals . 
_t4 		so you need to be good to trees . 
_t4 		mmmm , that's someone who's helping to clean up an oil spill showing what the oil looks like . 
_t4 		that's a different kind of oil +... 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 		oh .

_t4 		mmmm .
