_t4 		she is small and very funny . 
_t4 		sometimes I have_to keep an eye on her and sometimes I have_to give her dinner . 
_t4 		this is difficult because Lola is a very fussy eater . 
_t4 		Lola won't eat carrots of course . 
_t4 		she says carrots are for rabbits . 
_t4 		I say what about peas ? 
_t4 		Lola says peas are too small and too green . 
_t4 		one day I played a good trick on her . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		Lola was sitting at the table waiting for her dinner .
_t4 
_t4 		those are oranges . 
_t4 		and I said . 
_t4 		and she said I do not eat peas or carrots or potatoes . 
_t4 		or mushrooms or spaghetti . 
_t4 		or eggs or sausages . 
_t4 		I do not eat cauliflower , cabbage or baked beans .
_t4 		or bananas or oranges . 

_t4 		we are not going to eat any peas , or carrots , or potatoes , or mushrooms , or spaghetti , eggs , or sausages .
_t4 
_t4 		that's Charlie . 
_t4 		there will be no cauliflower , cabbage , baked beans , bananas , or oranges . 
_t4 		and we don't have any apples , rice , cheese , or fish sticks . 
_t4 		and certainly no tomatoes . 
_t4 		Lola looked at the table . 
_t4 		then why are these carrots there Charlie . 
_t4 		I don't ever eat carrots . 
_t4 		what's that ? 
_t4 		does that look like the moon to you ? 
_t4 		yeah , that's Saturn . 
_t4 		that's a planet . 
_t4 		they look just like carrots to me said Lola .
_t4 
_t4 		that's a star . 
_t4 		like I wonder if they're confused . 
_t4 		(be)cause it's not a star shape . 
_t4 		ya [: you] know . 
_t4 		there's Lola and she's sitting with a green alien . 
_t4 		from Jupiter . 
_t4 		I think . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		and there's Charlie , he's in a spaceship . 
_t4 		how can they be carrots I said ? 
_t4 		carrots don't grow in Jupiter . 
_t4 		that's true said Lola . 
_t4 		I might just try one . 
_t4 		if they came all the way from Jupiter . 
_t4 		not bad she said . 
_t4 		and took another bite . 
_t4 		then Lola saw some peas , I don't eat peas said Lola . 
_t4 		I said these are not peas , of course they're not , these are green drops from Greenland . 
_t4 		they're made out of green and they fall from the sky . 
_t4 		but I don't eat green things , Lola said . 
_t4 		oh goody , then I'll have your share , green drops are so incredibly rare .
_t4 
_t4 		that's Charlie . 
_t4 		maybe I'll just nibble on one or two she said .
_t4 		quite tasty . 
_t4 		next Lola saw the potato . 
_t4 		next Lola saw the potato , I will not eat potatoes , so don't even try , not even mashed .
_t4 
_t4 		that's a big potato . 
_t4 		oh this isn't mashed potato , people often think it is but it's cloud fluff .
_t4 
_t4 		oh she said , in that case a large helping for me please , I love to eat cloud .
_t4 
_t4 		that's a mountain . 
_t4 		Mount Fugi . 

_t4 		really ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		were we skipping the fish sticks ? 

_t4 
_t4 		and I said what ? 
_t4 		one of those ? 
_t4 		and Lola said yes Charlie , one of those ? 
_t4 		and I couldn't believe my eyes (be)cause she was pointing at the tomatoes .
_t4 
_t4 		that's Charlie . 
_t4 		that's Charlie's chin . 
_t4 		where's your chin ? 
_t4 		there it is . 
_t4 		and I said are you sure , really one of these ? 
_t4 		and she said of course . 
_t4 		what's that ? 
_t4 		a moon . 
_t4 		you didn't think they were tomatoes , did you Charlie ?
_t4 
_t4 		there's Charlie . 
_t4 		there's Lola . 
_t4 		Lola . 
_t4 		I see you have purple paint on your fingers honey . 

_t4 		ocean nibbles . 
_t4 		those are really fish sticks . 

_t4 
_t4 		it was fish and chips , which like she wouldn't touch .
_t4 
_t4 		and then like a huge container of chocolate pudding with a candy bar to crumble in it .
