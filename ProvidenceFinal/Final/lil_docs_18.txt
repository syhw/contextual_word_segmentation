_d2645 
_d2645 		those are oranges . 

_d2645 		(be)cause it's not a star shape . 

_d2645 		yeah . 
_d2645 		and there's Charlie , he's in a spaceship . 
_d2645 		how can they be carrots I said ? 
_d2645 		carrots don't grow in Jupiter . 
_d2645 		that's true said Lola . 
_d2645 		I might just try one . 
_d2645 		if they came all the way from Jupiter . 
_d2645 		not bad she said . 
_d2645 		and took another bite . 
_d2645 		then Lola saw some peas , I don't eat peas said Lola . 
_d2645 		I said these are not peas , of course they're not , these are green drops from Greenland . 
_d2645 		they're made out of green and they fall from the sky . 
_d2645 		but I don't eat green things , Lola said . 

_d2645 		next Lola saw the potato , I will not eat potatoes , so don't even try , not even mashed .
_d2645 
_d2645 		that's a big potato . 
_d2645 		oh this isn't mashed potato , people often think it is but it's cloud fluff .
_d2645 
_d2645 		oh she said , in that case a large helping for me please , I love to eat cloud .
