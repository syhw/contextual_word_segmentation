_t4 		and the words Fredrick ? 
_t4 		Fredrick cleared his throat . 
_t4 		waited a moment . 

_t4 		who melts the ice ? 
_t4 		who spoils the weather ? 

_t4 		I'm tired , and I'm bored and I have kinks in my leg . 
_t4 		from sitting , just sitting here day after day . 
_t4 		it's work , how I hate it , I'd much rather play . 

_t4 		fly off for a rest . 
_t4 		if I could find someone to stay on my +... 
_t4 		nest . 
_t4 		if I could fins someone I'd fly away free . 
_t4 		then Horton the elephant passed by her tree . 
_t4 		hello said the lazy bird , smiling her best . 
_t4 		she has a tail , you're right . 
_t4 		you're right , Horton's [: Horton has] got a tail too . 

_t4 		and you fell down too . 
_t4 		whoa .

_t4 		alright . 
_t4 		bye bye Horton . 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		the elephant laughed . 
_t4 		of all silly things . 
_t4 		I haven't feathers and I haven't wings . 
_t4 		me on our egg . 
_t4 		why that doesn't make sense . 
_t4 		and I'm so +...
_t4 
_t4 		immense . 
_t4 		tut tut , answered Mazy . 
_t4 		I know you're not small . 
_t4 		but I'm sure you can do it no trouble at all . 
_t4 		just sit on it softly . 
_t4 		you're gentle and kind . 
_t4 		sweet stuff , I'm not done with that page . 
_t4 		do you want to finish the page ? 
_t4 		I can't said the elephant . 
_t4 		please begged the bird . 
_t4 		I won't be gone long , I give you my word . 
_t4 		I'll hurry right back I'll never be missed . 
_t4 		very well said the elephant . 
_t4 		since you insist . 
_t4 		you want a vacation . 
_t4 		go fly off and take it . 
_t4 		I'll sit on your egg and try not to break it . 
_t4 		hmmm , the first thing to do murmured Horton , let's see . 
_t4 		first thing to do is to prop up this tree . 
_t4 		and make it much stronger that has to be done . 
_t4 		before I get on , I must weigh a +//. 
_t4 		a ton . 
_t4 		then Horton the elephant smiled . 
_t4 		now that's that . 
_t4 		and he sat and he sat and he sat and he sat . 
_t4 		and sat all that day and kept the egg warm .
_t4 
_t4 		it's raining . 
_t4 		it's raining very hard , isn't it ? 
_t4 		through a terrible storm . 
_t4 		and it poured and it lightning . 
_t4 		it thundered and rumbled . 
_t4 		this isn't much fun , the elephant grumbled . 
_t4 		but Mazy by that time was far beyond reach . 
_t4 		enjoying the sunshine , way off in Palm Beach . 
_t4 		and having such fun , such a wonderful rest . 
_t4 		decided she'd never go back to her nest . 
_t4 		oh no . 
_t4 		there's snow all over Horton . 
_t4 		so Horton kept sitting there day after day . 
_t4 		and soon it was autumn the leaves blew away . 
_t4 		and then came the winter . 
_t4 		the snow and the sleet . 
_t4 		and the icicles hung from his trunk and his feet . 
_t4 		so  , poor Horton sat there the whole winter through .
_t4 
_t4 		he's all clean now . 
_t4 		and then came spring time with troubles anew . 
_t4 		his friends gathered round and shouted with glee . 
_t4 		look Horton the elephant is up in a tree . 
_t4 		they taunted and teased him and said how absurd . 
_t4 		old Horton the elephant thinks he's a bird . 
_t4 		no matter what happens this egg must be tended . 
_t4 		but poor Horton .
_t4 
_t4 		right .
_t4 
_t4 		they are wearing suits . 
_t4 		black eyes right . 
_t4 		three hunters came up softly from behind . 
_t4 		he heard the men's footsteps and turned with a start . 
_t4 		three rifles were aiming right straight at his heart . 
_t4 		did he run ? 
_t4 		he did not .
_t4 
_t4 		Horton stayed on that nest . 
_t4 		held his head high . 
_t4 		and threw out his chest . 
_t4 		and he looked at the hunters as much as to say . 
_t4 		shoot if you must but I won't run away . 
_t4 		but the men didn't shoot much to his surprise . 
_t4 		they dropped their three guns and stared with wide eyes . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		and the first thing he knew they had built a big wagon .
_t4 
_t4 		yeah that's one of the hunters . 
_t4 		and dug up his tree and put it inside . 
_t4 		with Horton so sad he practically cried . 
_t4 		up out of the jungle up into the sky . 
_t4 		up over the mountains +...
_t4 
_t4 		is that a baby elephant ? 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 
_t4 		then down down the mountains and down into the sea went the cart and the elephant . 
_t4 		with nest and tree . 
_t4 		that's one of the hunters .
_t4 
_t4 		he's pushing that cart . 
_t4 		there's a fish .
_t4 
_t4 		he's swimming you're right . 
_t4 		he's swimming in the water , you're right .
_t4 
_t4 		Horton , Horton is on a ship . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		right .
_t4 
_t4 		red boat or a yellow boat . 
_t4 		right .
_t4 
_t4 		out of the wagon and onto a ship . 

_t4 		one day Mister and Misses Brown were standing in Paddington station . 
_t4 		they were waiting for their daughter Judy who was coming home from school . 
_t4 		suddenly Mr Brown noticed something small and furry behind a pile of mail bags .
_t4 		look over there he said to Mrs Brown . 
_t4 		I'm sure I saw a +//. 
_t4 		a bear . 
_t4 		a bear said Mrs Brown . 
_t4 		in Paddington station . 
_t4 		don't be silly Henry there can't be . 
_t4 		xxx this is Stephanie Stephanie this is  by the way . 
_t4 		hi .
_t4 
_t4 		hi .
_t4 
_t4 		nice to meet you . 
_t4 		nice to meet you too . 
_t4 		but there it was it had a funny kind of hat and was sitting all by itself in an old suitcase near the lost property office . 
_t4 		as they drew near the bear stood up and politely drew raised it's hat . 
_t4 		good afternoon it said in a small clear voice . 
_t4 		can I help you ? 
_t4 		we were wondering if we could help you said Mrs Brown . 
_t4 		where ever have you come from ? 
_t4 		the bear looked around carefully before replying . 
_t4 		darkest Peru . 
_t4 		I stowed away and lived on Marmalade . 
_t4 		it said simply please look after this bear . 
_t4 		thank you . 
_t4 		aunt Lucy . 
_t4 		Henry she exclaimed we shall have_to take him home with us . 
_t4 		but we don't even know his name began Mr Brown . 
_t4 		we'll call him +//. 
_t4 		Paddington said Mrs Brown . 
_t4 		because that's where we +//. 
_t4 		found him . 
_t4 		Mrs Brown went off to look Judy and Mr Brown took Paddington into the cafeteria for something to eat . 
_t4 		he left Paddington sitting at a table in the corner near the window . 
_t4 		and he soon returned carrying two steaming cups of tea and a large plate piled high with +//. 
_t4 		sticky cakes . 
_t4 		after his long journey Paddington felt so hungry and thirsty he didn't know which to do first eat or drink . 
_t4 		I think I'll try both at the same time if you don't mind Mr Brown he announced . 
_t4 		and without waiting for a reply he climbed up on to the table . 
_t4 		Mr Brown steered out of the window pretending he had tea with a bear at Paddington station everyday of his life . 
_t4 		what's Paddington doing ? 
_t4 		oh+my+goodness . 
_t4 		he's standing on the table . 
_t4 		when Mrs Brown came into the cafeteria with Judy she threw her hands up with horror . 
_t4 		Henry she said what are you doing to that poor bear . 
_t4 		he's covered all over with cream and jam . 
_t4 		oh is that the mommy . 
_t4 		that's Mrs Brown the mommy . 
_t4 		and there's the daddy . 
_t4 		and +//. 
_t4 		that's Judy right ? 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		I think we better go before anything else happens said Mr Brown . 
_t4 		and quickly led the way out of the cafeteria . 
_t4 		Judy took Paddington's paw and squeezed it . 
_t4 		what's on Paddington's foot ? 
_t4 		is that a cup ? 
_t4 		oh+my+goodness . 
_t4 		that is so messy . 
_t4 		come along she said we'll take you home in a taxi . 
_t4 		and you both can have a nice hot bath . 
_t4 		Paddington had never been in a taxi before . 
_t4 		do you remember what color the taxis are in New York ? 
_t4 		in New York are they yellow ? 
_t4 		yes . 
_t4 		he found it very exciting and stood on a lil [: little] tip up seat behind the driver so he could wave to the people on the street . 
_t4 		oh that's okay sweetie . 
_t4 		you want that ? 
_t4 		soon they pulled up outside a large house with a green front door . 
_t4 		when they were indoors Judy took Paddington up to his room to unpack . 
_t4 		I haven't gotten very much said Paddington only some marmalade . 
_t4 		and my scrapbook . 
_t4 		and this sort of South American penny . 
_t4 		he held up a photograph and that's my aunt Lucy . 
_t4 		she had it taken right before she went into the home for retired bears . 
_t4 		what does that look like ? 
_t4 		it looks like a dime ? 
_t4 		I think it's a sort of penny . 
_t4 		it's a type of penny . 
_t4 		next Judy showed Paddington to the bathroom . 
_t4 		as soon as he was on his own he turned on the taps and climbed onto a stool to look out the window . 
_t4 		then he tried writing his name on the steamy glass with his paw . 
_t4 		it took him rather a long time . 
_t4 		and when he looked around he found his surprise the bath was so full of water it started to run over the side . 
_t4 		oh no . 
_t4 		he closed his eyes and holding his nose with one paw . 
_t4 		he jumped in . 
_t4 		the water was hot soapy and very deep . 
_t4 		then to his horror he found he couldn't get out . 
_t4 		he couldn't even see to turn the taps off . 
_t4 		oh no ! 
_t4 		Paddington tried calling out help at first in a quiet voice so it's not to disturb anyone and then much louder . 
_t4 		help help ! 
_t4 		but still nobody came . 
_t4 		then he had an idea . 
_t4 		he took off his hat and began to use it to bail out the water . 
_t4 		downstairs Judy was telling her brother all about Paddington . 
_t4 		when suddenly she felt a plop . 
_t4 		looking up she saw a dark wet patch on the ceiling . 
_t4 		Paddington she called he must be in trouble . 
_t4 		quick ! 
_t4 		and together they raced out of the room . 
_t4 		Jonathan and Judy leaned over the side of the bath and lifted a dripping and very frightened Paddington onto the floor . 
_t4 		what a mess said Jonathan . 
_t4 		we better wipe it up pretty quickly . 
_t4 		oh Paddington said Judy what good luck we found you .
_t4 
_t4 		look at all that water on Paddington . 
_t4 		they took him out of the bath tub . 
_t4 		he's so wet isn't he ? 
_t4 		yes . 
_t4 		Paddington sat up and said what good luck I had my hat . 
_t4 		sometime later a beautifully clean Paddington came downstairs . 
_t4 		settling himself down in a small arm chair by the fire . 
_t4 		he put his paws behind his head and stretched out his toes . 
_t4 		it was nice being a bear . 
_t4 		especially a bear called Paddington . 
_t4 		he had a feeling that life with the Brown's was going to be +//. 
_t4 		fun . 
_t4 		oh boy .

_t4 		Paddington's garden . 
_t4 		one day Paddington decided to make a list of all the nice things there were about being a bear and living with the Brown's at number thirty two Winsor Gardens . 
_t4 		it was a long list and he had almost reached the end of the paper when he suddenly realized he left out one of the nicest things of all . 
_t4 		the garden itself . 
_t4 		wow that's nice . 
_t4 		Paddington liked the Brown's garden . 
_t4 		it was quiet and peacefully and there were times when it might not have been in London at all . 
_t4 		but nice gardens usually mean a lot of hard work . 
_t4 		and after a day at his office Mr Brown often wished it wasn't quite so large . 
_t4 		what's that ? 
_t4 		there's Mrs Brown she's the mommy . 
_t4 		and the daddy too . 
_t4 		it was Mrs Brown who first thought of giving Jonathan Judy and Paddington a piece each of their own . 
_t4 		it will keep them out of mischief she said . 
_t4 		and will help you at the same time . 
_t4 		so Mr Brown marked up three squares and to make it more exciting he said he would give a price to whom ever had the best idea . 
_t4 		early next morning all three set to work . 
_t4 		Judy thought she would grow some flowers and Jonathan started to make a paved garden . 
_t4 		but Paddington didn't know what to do . 
_t4 		gardening was much harder than it looked . 
_t4 		especially with paws and he soon grew tired of digging . 
_t4 		in the end he decided to do some shopping . 
_t4 		he had some savings .
_t4 
_t4 		oh look he's buying what's he buying ? 
_t4 		seeds . 
_t4 		and he has a basket . 
_t4 		and the trowel . 
_t4 		and he's gonna buy a lil [: little] wheel barrel to . 
_t4 		it seemed very good value indeed . 
_t4 		especially since he had two pence left over . 
_t4 		the shop keeper told him that when planning a new garden it was a good idea to stand some way away first in order to picture what it would look like when it was finished . 
_t4 		so taking a jar of his best chunky marmalade . 
_t4 		Paddington set out to visit the near by building site . 
_t4 		by the time he got there it was the middle of the morning . 
_t4 		and as the men were all at their tea break he sat down on a pile of bricks . 
_t4 		and put down his jar of marmalade . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		after sitting there for some while without getting a single idea pit . 
_t4 		Paddington decided to take a short walk instead . 
_t4 		when he got back his eyes nearly popped out . 
_t4 		a man was emptying the concrete mixer on the very spot where he had left his jar of marmalade . 
_t4 		oh my ! 
_t4 		at that moment the foreman came round and seen the look on Paddington's face . 
_t4 		he stopped to ask what was wrong . 
_t4 		oh my chunks have been buried he exclaimed hotly . 
_t4 		so they all set to work clearing the cement . 
_t4 		but there was no sign of Paddington's jar . 
_t4 		suddenly there was a worrying sound from over head . 
_t4 		a platform landed at his feet . 
_t4 		my marmalade he said . 
_t4 		I put it there ready for my tea break and it must have been taken out by mistake . 
_t4 		that's quick drying cement . 
_t4 		it's probably rock hard . 
_t4 		and no one will give me two pence for it now . 
_t4 		I will said Paddington . 
_t4 		and he took the lumps of concrete home . 
_t4 		when the builders saw +...
_t4 
_t4 		there's his wheelbarrow . 
_t4 		and his concrete and his trowel . 
_t4 		concrete . 
_t4 		wheelbarrow . 
_t4 		trowel . 
_t4 		trowel . 
_t4 		and his seeds started to grow . 
_t4 		and they celebrated by having tea in the new garden . 
_t4 		after it was over Paddington stayed on for a while in order to finish his list of all the nice things there were . 
_t4 		about being a bear and living at thiry+two Winsor Gardens . 
_t4 		he had one more important item to add . 
_t4 		my rockery . 
_t4 		and signed his name and added his special paw print just to show that it was +//. 
_t4 		genuine . 
_t4 		very good .
_t4 
_t4 		yay !
_t4 
_t4 		genuine . 
_t4 		okay .
