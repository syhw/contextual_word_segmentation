_t4 		mmmm+hmmm , mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		xxx mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		yeah , yeah . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		well , it's partly +//. 
_t4 		it's not  , completely  good or bad , it's partly about what your level of tolerance is , I mean that (.) that's part of the equation , I mean +...
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 		yeah , sure . 
_t4 		no I (.) well +... 
_t4 		I don't , I don't like , I don't like it , I wish it weren't happening but I'm also not willing to do (.) what it takes +//.
_t4 		well I mean I am willing to do what it takes to reduce it , but not to (.) force it , if you know what I mean . 
_t4 		and , and I think she +//.
_t4 		it is (.) well , I can go on and on on this topic , it's like all I ever think about , to be honest with you  ! 
_t4 		but the +//.
_t4 		I mean no , that's an exaggeration , but +... 
_t4 		(be)cause sleep is important , that's why . 
_t4 		for all of us . 
_t4 		she doesn't have a sleeping problem (be)cause she sleeps right +//.
_t4 		I mean , she barely wakes up to nurse . 
_t4 		so it's not a question about her not sleeping , it's a question about me not sleeping . 
_t4 		no ,  , what we did +... 
_t4 		is (.) a couple of months , well maybe like three or four months ago we got a single bed and put it next to our king+sized bed in our bedroom . 
_t4 		so she sleeps on that much of the night . 
_t4 		and she +//.
_t4 		so she's farther away from me . 
_t4 		and I either go down to her bed to nurse her +//.
_t4 		and , and I try to just wait and see if she's really waking up to nurse or not . 
_t4 		you know , so +//.
_t4 		(be)cause sometimes she'll almost wake up but then she'll go back to sleep without being nursed . 
_t4 		so , it's also about listening carefully and waiting . 
_t4 but anyway sometimes I'll go down to her 
_t4  bed to nurse her and sometimes I'll bring her up to the bed , and sometimes I'll have the energy to put her back on hers and other times she just stays in bed . 
_t4 		I mean I'm not , I , I don't feel , feel like I have an ideal situation . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		can I , can I tell you about a book that I like though about this topic ,  +... 
_t4 		it's called the no cry sleep solution . 
_t4 		um , and I , I like her approach (be)cause she's kind of like , she's kind of like ,  +... 
_t4 		well , it's hard to describe but , you know , middle of the +//.
_t4 		like if you need to sleep , she's got suggestions on what you can do , and yet she +... 
_t4 		recognizes there are lots_of people like me , at least , who want , like no crying  . 
_t4 		but want to sleep . 
_t4 		so it's kinda [: kind of] like way +//.
_t4 		like , possible ways of making that happen . 
_t4 		and it didn't +//.
_t4 		I can't say that (.) and it's also one of these things that's not a rigid plan , it's more like an approach and suggestions , and +... 
_t4 		stuff like that , so , it's not like you have_to follow a plan . 
_t4 		yeah ,  I think she's got some really good ideas , and +... 
_t4 		apparently , I mean +//.
_t4 		and I was also on an , an e+mail group of people who are following her plan , and there's like eight hundred people on the list . 
_t4 so I don't follow it 
_t4  I mean I kinda [: kind of] like 
_t4  I just kind of abandoned it for the time being but 
_t4  but I 
_t4  but I think a lot of people are actually having success with her method . 
_t4 		and a lot of people aren't too , I mean I'd say that , it's like one of those things . 
_t4 		so +... 
_t4 		yeah , yeah .
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 		and the , yeah , go back , yeah , yeah . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		yup [: yes] , yeah .
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm , think of +//.
_t4 		think through what you might wanna do . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		and that's hard for him ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 		yeah ,  +...
_t4 		oh I have +//.
_t4 		you know , that's exactly what has happened to me .
_t4 		I just started , at a certain point I started getting insomnia .
_t4 		like , inability to go back to sleep . 
_t4 		and that just completely complicates things .
_t4 		and , I think it was around when she was  age , that that was happening to me too . 
_t4 		um , I can jump to the punchline that one , one of her major suggestions in that book is to +...
_t4 		him to sleep . 
_t4 		um , before , so that he doesn't actually fall asleep with a nipple in his mouth .
_t4 		and she's just , kind of suggests that you do that religiously and repeatedly +...
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 		yeah (.) well that's +//.
_t4 		she's not saying that to do that .
_t4 		yeah sure , yeah yeah .
_t4 		xxx okay now we can read bunny cakes . 
_t4 		now we can read bunny cakes . 
_t4 		bunny cakes . 
_t4 		who's in bunny cakes  who's that story about ? 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		where's Max in that picture ? 
_t4 		he's sitting in a mixing bowl .
_t4 		silly Max . 
_t4 		ha   .
_t4 		let see  we gotta make sure Mommy's your head it's on Mommy's mice . 
_t4 		hmmm what's he have in his hand ? 
_t4 		ha .
_t4 		that Max . 
_t4 		I can't believe he fits in the mixing bowl is he that little ? 
_t4 		he must be little if he fits in a mixing bowl . 
_t4 		this is still March first . 
_t4 		bunny cakes . 
_t4 		oh here's some pictures of things . 
_t4 		what do you see .
_t4 		yeah those are eggs .
_t4 		let's count those eggs . 
_t4 		one two three four five six eggs . 
_t4 		that is a spoon .
_t4 		do you see where the mixer is ? 
_t4 		does that look like Mommy's mixer ? 
_t4 		it's Ruby's yeah that one is Ruby's mixer . 
_t4 		oh cause there's two pictures here . 
_t4 		I see the butter I thought Ruby uses butter to make the cake . 
_t4 		I think that's the butter . 
_t4 		yeah rubber spatula .
_t4 		I think Ruby uses the rubber spatula to mix the cake . 
_t4 		and she also uses ? 
_t4 		the whisk . 
_t4 		and  there's the flour what's the flour in ? 
_t4 		in a red bag isn't it ? 
_t4 		with a number two on it . 
_t4 		and I see some measuring spoons . 
_t4 		and a measuring cup . 
_t4 		Mommy has a cup like that . 
_t4 		okay bunny cakes . 
_t4 		it was grandma's birthday Max made her an earth worm what ? 
_t4 		what's he doing there ? 
_t4 		it looks like he's using a metal spatula to mix his cake . 
_t4 		which is really just made out of dirt . 
_t4 		that's actually dirt he's pretending to make a cake out of dirt . 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 		Max wanted to help . 
_t4 		don't touch anything Max said Ruby . 
_t4 		you think she does I think he does want to help Ruby . 
_t4 		does she want him to help ? 
_t4 		I don't think she wants him to help . 
_t4 		you think he's gonna touch the eggs ? 
_t4 		he might what's Ruby doing with that egg ? 
_t4 		she's breaking it into the mixer . 
_t4 		mixing bowl actually she's breaking it into the mixing bowl . 
_t4 		she's holding on to the shells and letting the egg white and the egg yoke going into the bowl . 
_t4 		what she making do you remember ? 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		but it was too late oops what happened ? 
_t4 		he broke the eggs .
_t4 		well you can't really fix eggs once you break them . 
_t4 		you have_to throw if you break them and they go on the floor you have_to throw them in the garbage . 
_t4 		maybe maybe Ruby will help Max clean that up and put it in the garbage . 
_t4 		maybe they'll do it together you think so ? 
_t4 		yeah maybe Max and Ruby will do that . 
_t4 		Ruby send Max to the store with a list that said . 
_t4 		eggs . 
_t4 		for his earth worm cake so he wrote red hot marshmallow squirters on the list . 
_t4 		he wrote it with a red crayon except he's a little bunny and he doesn't really know how to write . 
_t4 		he can't write he's a bunny but he's trying he's trying to write he wants to add red hot marshmallows squirters to the list so the grocer will give them to him . 
_t4 		that's a kind of candy . 
_t4 		the grocer could not read Max's writing . 
_t4 		eggs said the grocer and he gave Max eggs . 
_t4 		Max brought the eggs home to Ruby . 
_t4 		oh I think they're in that red box . 
_t4 		don't bump the table Max  but it was too late . 
_t4 		what happened ? 
_t4 		he spilled the milk . 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 		she said don't bump the table Max but he did bump the table you see he's bumping into it right there and the milk bottle is falling over the milk is going on to the floor . 
_t4 		oh  who do you think is gonna clean that up ? 
_t4 		I think she's going to ask Max to help her clean it up don't you think ? 
_t4 		when you make a mess you should help clean it up right ? 
_t4 		Ruby sent Max back to the store with a list that said ? 
_t4 		milk how do you spell milk ? 
_t4 		right .
_t4 		great m i l k spells milk very good Naima . 
_t4 		this time Max wrote red hot marshmallows squirters in a different way . 
_t4 		he really wants that candy . 
_t4 		Max hoped and hoped for his squirters but the grocer still couldn't read Max's writing milk said the grocer and he gave Max milk . 
_t4 		what else is the grocer selling there ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 		and what about over there ? 
_t4 		I think those are crackers .
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		Max brought the milk home to Ruby . 
_t4 		what did she do Naima ? 
_t4 		what did she draw ? 
_t4 		she drew a yellow line on the floor next to the table . 
_t4 		there's a yellow line on the floor Max said Ruby . 
_t4 		you can't step over that line . 
_t4 		I think she's a little bit mad . 
_t4 		he's bringing her the milk . 
_t4 		but Max . 
_t4 		he crossed over the line . 
_t4 		oops what happened . 
_t4 		what did he do ? 
_t4 		did he spill ? 
_t4 		he spilled the flour .
_t4 		oh  over went the flour . 
_t4 		Ruby got out her pencil and she .
_t4 		Ruby got out her pencil . 
_t4 		what did she write ?
_t4 		she wrote flour how do you spell flour ?
_t4 		f l o u r . 
_t4 		flour . 
_t4 		this time Max wrote red hot marshmallows squirters in the most beautiful writing he knew . 
_t4 		he's using a crayon isn't he ? 
_t4 		Max could almost taste the marshmallows squirters . 
_t4 		flour said the grocer and he gave Max flour . 
_t4 		oh I think Max might be unhappy . 
_t4 		that's the grocer . 
_t4 		the grocer doesn't know that Max wants the candy because he can't read what Max wrote on the list . 
_t4 		Max is just a little guy he doesn't really know how to write or talk properly . 
_t4 		that's the door to the kitchen . 
_t4 		these are trees over here and that's the door to the kitchen and there's Ruby inside holding a spoon . 
_t4 		when Max got home there was a sign on the kitchen door . 
_t4 		Max this kitchen is no place for you said Ruby . 
_t4 		Ruby finished up her cake whose ears do you see outside the window ? 
_t4 		those are Max's ears .
_t4 		Ruby won't let him into the kitchen . 
_t4 		he's outside looking in yeah . 
_t4 		Ruby finished up her cake she baked it and cooled it and iced it with raspberry fluff frosting . 
_t4 		she's using something to put the frosting on the cake ? 
_t4 		oh she gave him a spoon of the icing . 
_t4 		he's eating some of the icing just a little spoon full . 
_t4 		he's trying just a little bit . 
_t4 		he's outside the window looking in . 
_t4 		she's using a knife to put the frosting on the cake . 
_t4 		that's a very pink cake . 
_t4 		it needs something else Max said Ruby . 
_t4 		birthday candles silver stars sugar hearts butter cream roses wrote Ruby . 
_t4 		mean while Max had a brand new idea . 
_t4 		what's he pulling behind him ? 
_t4 		yeah it's a red wagon there .
_t4 		maybe he's going to carry the food from the grocery store in the wagon when he goes home . 
_t4 		what does the list say ? 
_t4 		it says birthday candles silver . 
_t4 		sugar . 
_t4 		and butter cream . 
_t4 		and what're those ? 
_t4 		he drew a picture of red hot marshmallows squirters . 
_t4 		well he won't have_to wait too long . 
_t4 		birthday candles silver stars sugar hearts butter cream roses said the grocer what's this why it must be a red hot marshmallow . 
_t4 		squirters . 
_t4 		Ruby's cake looked just beautiful . 
_t4 		Max went out and put caterpillar icing on his birthday cake . 
_t4 		on his on his earth worm cake .
_t4 		what's he doing what's he having in his hand ? 
_t4 		what's he doing with the knife ? 
_t4 		he's putting caterpillar icing on the cake with his knife . 
_t4 		Grandma was so thrilled she didn't know which cake to eat first . 
_t4 		how many cakes does she have ? 
_t4 		right she has two cakes very good .
_t4 		that's the end I think . 
_t4 		do you wanna read another book ? 
_t4 		you wanna read Bunny Money ? 
_t4 		you wanna read it to Mommy ? 
_t4 		oh I have_to read it to you okay . 
_t4 		maybe we read it together . 
_t4 		xxx what does Ruby have ? 
_t4 		what's in her wallet ? 
_t4 		oh what're they going to do now ? 
_t4 		they gonna go on the bus . 
_t4 		yes I think they're gonna go to the store . 
_t4 		Ruby took a dollar from her wallet to pay the bus fair who's she giving the money to ? 
_t4 		the bus driver .
_t4 		oh here they're at the store do you know what the store is called ? 
_t4 		in the window was a music box with skating ballerinas . 
_t4 		isn't it beautiful Max said Ruby ? 
_t4 		thirsty said Max . 
_t4 		you may buy a very very small lemonade Max said Ruby what's she giving him now ? 
_t4 		she's giving him her wallet do you think that's a good idea ? 
_t4 		next door in Candy's corner window were hundreds of vampire teeth . 
_t4 		Max knew grandma would love a set of teeth with oozing cherry syrup inside for her birthday . 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 		he bought them instead of the lemonade . 
_t4 		two dollars please said Candy . 
_t4 		what're they gonna do what's this ? 
_t4 		a washing machine .
_t4 		and what's Ruby doing over here this is Max . 
_t4 		this is Ruby's hand . 
_t4 		I think Ruby is cleaning off his face with a washcloth .
_t4 		because he has mess on his face . 
_t4 		soap cost a dollar the washer cost a dollar and the dryer cost another dollar . 
_t4 		money down the drain Max said Ruby .
