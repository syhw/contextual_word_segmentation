_d6019 		it's okay like this .
_d6019 		it's okay like this . 
_d6019 		xxx but the important thing is not to touch that too much .

_d6019 		(be)cause that would mean we'd just hear fuzz when we play it back 
_d6019 		this is the microphone , if you touch it it's gonna (.) give a fuzz sound which won't be good .
_d6020 		no .

_d6020 		this way that+a+way . 
_d6020 		oh , clunk  . 
_d6020 		I don't think we're gonna have a blizzard like that in a long time , Naima . 
_d6020 		that was probably one of the worst blizzards that Cape Cod has had in the last fifty years . 
_d6020 		it's a lotta [: lot of] years , yep [: yes] . 
_d6020 		twelve is a lotta [: lot of] years too . 
_d6020 		yeah . 
_d6020 		yep [: yes] . 
_d6020 		there was a very bad blizzard , almost this bad , seventeen years ago . 
_d6020 		that's a long time ago too , isn't it ? 
_d6020 		I guess Daddy will wear his mic(rophone) . 
_d6020 		although it's actually Naima's . 
_d6020 		a voice we really wanna have on our recording . 
_d6020 		I wish Naima would wear the microphone on her shirt so we would have a very good recording . 
_d6020 		if she stays where she is right now it'll be fine . 
_d6020 		if you wore the microphone on your shirt we would have a very good recording . 
_d6020 		oh , I know , that's what Mommy says .
_d6020 		but I think if you really wanted a really good recording , you would wear it on your shirt . 
_d6020 		if you wanted it . 
_d6020 		that way we +/.
_d6020 		I'm gotta open up my store .

_d6020 		okay .
_d6020 		I'm I'm videotaping people at my store . 
_d6020 		oh , some stores do that , did you realize that ? 
_d6020 		some stores do that to protect themselves from robbers . 
_d6020 		well sometimes robbers go into stores when they wanna steal things and not pay money .
_d6020 		well because if it's recorded on the video then we have a picture of who the robber was and then the police can go find them later . 
_d6020 		so , that tells them they really shouldn't do that (be)cause they'll get caught very easily . 
_d6020 		well because if they know that there's pictures being taken of them , then (.) then they'll know that police can find them . 
_d6020 		yeah , that's the idea . 
_d6020 		so: , shall we go to the store ? 
_d6020 		(o)kay .
