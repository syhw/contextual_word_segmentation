_t4 		I was meant for bigger things ! 

_t4 		so one night he took Scuffy home to his little boy . 
_t4 		he filled the bathtub with water . 
_t4 		sail , little tugboat , said the little boy .
_t4 
_t4 		I won't sail in a bathtub , said Scuffy . 
_t4 		a tub is no place for a red painted tugboat . 
_t4 		I was meant for bigger things .
_t4 
_t4 		the next day , the man with the polka+dot tie and his little boy carried Scuffy to a river . 
_t4 		sail , little tugboat , said the man with the polka+dot tie . 
_t4 		and what did he do , Ethan ?

_t4 		and Scuffy moved along quickly down the stream , down the river .
_t4 
_t4 		come back , little tugboat , come back ! 
_t4 		cried the little boy .
_t4 
_t4 		not I , tooted Scuffy , not I . 
_t4 		this is the life for me !

_t4 		past cows , and women washing clothes ! 
_t4 		Scuffy almost got hit by a cow ! 
_t4 		that was not fun . 
_t4 		night came , and the moon came out . 

_t4 		suddenly an owl called out . 
_t4 		hoot , hoot ! 
_t4 		toot , toot ? 
_t4 		cried the little tugboat . 
_t4 		he was scared . 
_t4 		he wanted to see the man with the polka+dot tie . 
_t4 		the next morning , Scuffy moved on . 
_t4 		he saw two streams +...
_t4 
_t4 		to make a big river . 
_t4 		Scuffy sailed down the river . 
_t4 		he sailed past villages .
_t4 
_t4 		he sailed past men with logs . 
_t4 		what're [: what are] they doing , Ethan ? 
_t4 		they're gonna get the logs ready for the logging truck . 
_t4 		this is a fine river , said Scuffy , but it's very busy and big for me . 
_t4 		he sailed under some bridges . 
_t4 		the river got deeper and wider , and now there were big cities . 
_t4 		and big boats . 
_t4 		the river got deeper and deeper and deeper , and it moved faster and faster . 
_t4 		then , it started to rain , and Scuffy was riding on the waves . 
_t4 		up and down .
_t4 
_t4 		lots and lots and lots_of rain . 
_t4 		people had to bring cranes and put sandbags by the river +... 
_t4 		(be)cause the river was getting bigger and bigger and bigger , and higher and higher and higher . 
_t4 		and there's Scuffy , all alone . 
_t4 		on went the river to the sea . 
_t4 		at last , Scuffy sailed into a big city . 
_t4 		here the river got wider , and there were docks , and wharves , and big ships . 
_t4 		it was a big , noisy place .
_t4 
_t4 		and cranes loaded freight onto some ships . 
_t4 		Scuffy said toot , toot . 
_t4 		but nobody saw him , the little tugboat . 
_t4 		oh no , said Scuffy when he saw the great big ocean . 
_t4 		there's no beginning and no end to the sea . 
_t4 		I wish I could find the man with the polka+dot tie , and  +... 
_t4 		yup [: yes] , there's a red truck , and what's that ?

_t4 		mmmm , there's a lot of smoke coming out of those ships , isn't there ?
_t4 
_t4 		that's Scuffy again . 
_t4 		he's all by himself !
_t4 
_t4 		but look who picked him up . 
_t4 		who picked him up ? 
_t4 		the man with the polka+dot tie , and the little boy . 
_t4 		and he said , I wanna go home to the bathtub . 
_t4 		that's just the right size for me . 
_t4 		the end . 
