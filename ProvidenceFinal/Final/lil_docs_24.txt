_d2980 		mmmm .
_d2980 
_d2980 		Paddington's lucky day . 
_d2980 		you know Paddington lives in England . 
_d2980 		we went to England when we went to Ireland , the airplane stopped there .
_d2980 
_d2980 		it's a big outdoor market quite near here .
_d2980 
_d2981 		you should bring your pocket money added Jonathan . 
_d2981 		there's a lot to see . 
_d2981 		Paddington didn't need asking twice , and soon afterward they all set off . 
_d2981 		suddenly they turned a corner and found themself in what seemed like a different world . 
_d2981 		a world of outdoor stands and push+carts , gold and silver ornaments , books , old furniture , fruit and vegetables , people . 
_d2981 		his eyes grew larger and larger as he tried to take it all in . 
_d2981 		sweetie pie , you know what ? 
_d2981 		you know where we keep your books in your room ? 
_d2981 		in your bedroom ?
_d2981 
_d2981 		exactly , the thing that your diapers are in .
_d2981 
_d2981 		there's a picture on there , and Daddy and I bought that picture on Portabello road . 
_d2981 		before you were born .
_d2981 
_d2981 		and a picture of a Mommy and her little baby girl .
_d2981 
_d2981 		yeah .
_d2981 
_d2981 		one store was even having its picture taken . 
_d2981 		that's a new supermarket explained Judy .
_d2981 
_d2981 		there must be something special going on there .
_d2981 
_d2981 		do we like the supermarket ? 
_d2981 		what do you get at the supermarket ?
_d2981 
_d2981 		that's right .
_d2981 
_d2981 		Paddington's mouth began to water as he peered through the  , through the glass . 
_d2981 		perhaps I could do some shopping for you Missus Brown he said hopefully .
_d2981 
_d2981 		Missus Brown hesitated . 
_d2981 		she wasn't at all sure about letting him go off on his own quite so soon . 
_d2981 		but Jonathan told her not to worry . 
_d2981 		even Paddington can't get lost in a supermarket he said .
_d2981 
_d2981 		what goes in must come out . 
_d2981 		we can meet him back by the check+out counter on our way back added Judy . 
_d2981 		Paddington felt most important as he entered the store .
_d2981 
_d2981 		he lifted his hat to the manager who was standing just inside the door .
_d2981 
_d2981 		that's the manager . 
_d2981 		what's he wearing ?
_d2981 
_d2981 		a suit , right .
_d2981 
_d2981 		and that man's wearing a coat .
_d2981 
_d2981 		what's he wearing around his neck ? 
_d2981 		a tie , you're right .
_d2981 
_d2981 		and what's that man wearing on his face ? 
_d2981 		what's he wearing on his +//. 
_d2981 		over his eyes .
_d2981 
_d2981 		is he wearing  +/.
_d2981 
_d2981 		that's right , he's wearing glasses .
_d2981 
_d2981 		everywhere he looked there were shelves piled high with boxes and cans . 
_d2981 		there was even one shelf with nothing but marmalade . 
_d2981 		marmalade's [: marmalade is] like jam . 
_d2981 		do you like jam ? 
_d2981 		there it is , you're right . 
_d2981 		he could certainly see why it was called a super market . 
_d2981 		his paws were soon full , and he was just beginning to wish he's left his suitcase at home when he saw the manager coming towards him pushing a large basket on wheels . 
_d2981 		may I suggest you use one of these sir , he called . 
_d2981 		you can take as much as you want now , he continued . 
_d2981 		can I really , exclaimed Paddington . 
_d2981 		the manager nodded . 
_d2981 		yes , we like to make our customers happy . 
_d2981 		Paddington looked most impressed . 
_d2981 		in that case he said , I think I'll have two baskets just to make sure . 
_d2981 		the more Paddington saw of the super+market the more he liked it . 
_d2981 		and he was sure Missus Brown would be pleased when she saw all her free groceries . 
_d2981 		uh+oh . 
_d2981 		Paddington thinks he can take them for free . 
_d2981 		the other customers looked on in amazement . 
_d2981 		perhaps he's trying to win an eating prize suggested one lady as he went by . 
_d2981 		but the customers weren't the only ones who were watching Paddington with interest . 
_d2981 		since he had been in the sore , the manager had been joined by several other important looking men . 
_d2981 		and as Paddington reached the check out counter , one of them gave a signal and they all started to clap . 
_d2981 		Paddington had never been in a store where they tried so hard to make their customers happy , and he gave the man a friendly wave .
_d2981 
_d2981 		a+choo , did someone sneeze ? 
_d2981 		is your nose stuffy ?
_d2981 
_d2981 		do you want Mommy to clean it ?
_d2981 
_d2981 		your sneeze fell ? 
_d2981 		oh .
_d2981 
_d2981 		well done said the lady handing him a ticket . 
_d2981 		I hope you've brought a truck with you .
_d2981 
_d2981 		there's over a hundred and fifty dollars worth here . 
_d2981 		Paddington stared at the long roll of paper in his paw . 
_d2981 		over a hundred and fifty dollars worth , he gasped . 
_d2981 		but I've only got a nickel . 
_d2981 		looking up , Paddington suddenly caught sight of a crowd of people coming toward him . 
_d2981 		watch out , cried the lady as he made a grab for the groceries . 
_d2981 		but it was too late .
_d2981 
_d2981 		with a roar like an express train , everything began to tumble down off the counter . 
_d2981 		oh no it's falling on Paddington . 
_d2981 		Paddington was still sitting on the floor covered in groceries .
_d2981 
_d2981 		where's Paddington ? 
_d2981 		there he is .
_d2981 
_d2981 		he was still sitting on the floor covered with groceries when the Browns rushed into the store to see what was going on . 
_d2981 		all in all , he decided he was much safer where he was for the time being . 
_d2981 		what's that ? 
_d2981 		a turkey .
_d2981 
_d2981 		that's right . 
_d2981 		you wouldn't think , said the manager , that giving someone a prize would be so difficult .
_d2981 
_d2981 		a prize , echoed the Browns . 
_d2981 		and the manager pointed to a large notice on the wall . 
_d2981 		this young bear happens to be our thousandth customer today .
_d2981 
_d2981 		that's a big sign .
_d2981 
_d2981 		perhaps you'd like to tell him he's won a free supply of groceries . 
_d2981 		xxx , all of which , said Judy as they staggered home laden with groceries , only goes to show that bears always fall on their feet . 
_d2981 		even in super+markets . 
_d2981 		Paddington sniffed the air happily . 
_d2981 		I like Portabello road , he said .
_d2981 
_d2981 		I think I shall always do my shopping here from now on .
_d2981 
_d2981 		yay .
_d2981 
_d2981 		what book do you wanna read now ?
_d2981 
_d2981 		xxx .
_d2981 
_d2981 		which book is that ? 
_d2981 		Paddington at the seaside .
_d2981 
_d2981 		great .
_d2981 
_d2981 		he's got some floats on his arms . 
_d2981 		today , said Mister Brown at breakfast one bright summer morning , feels like the kind of day for taking a young bear to the seaside . 
_d2981 		hands up all those who agree . 
_d2981 		Jonathan , Judy , and Missus Brown all put up their hands . 
_d2981 		and Paddington raised both his paws as well , just to make sure .
_d2981 
_d2981 		there's a tent at the seaside , there is , we're gonna get to that , you're right . 
_d2981 		everyone was very excited , and by the time they set out , the Brown's car was so full of things there was scarcely room to move . 
_d2981 		Paddington carefully fastened his seat+belt . 
_d2981 		do you think he sits in a special car+seat like yours ? 
_d2981 		yes , I think so too .
_d2981 
_d2981 		are we nearly there Mister Brown he asked hopefully ?
_d2981 
_d2981 		he's looking out the window , you're right . 
_d2981 		Mister Brown removed a shovel handle from his left ear . 
_d2981 		I'm afraid not , he said gloomily , we've only just left Windsor gardens and it's a very long way to the sea . 
_d2981 		Mister Brown was right , it was a long journey . 
_d2981 		but when they reached the seaside , the sight of the land and water soon made up for it . 
_d2981 		Paddington gave an excited sniff as he climbed out of the car . 
_d2981 		even the air had a different smell . 
_d2981 		that's because it's special seaside air , said Missus Brown , it's very good for you .
_d2981 
_d2981 		what are those ? 
_d2981 		what are those ? 
_d2981 		remember what type of special bird they are , near the ocean ? 
_d2981 		are they seagulls ? 
_d2981 		yeah .
_d2981 
_d2981 		you saw a sign with seagulls on Waterman street .
_d2981 
_d2981 		when we were driving back .
_d2981 
_d2981 		she  , I just taught her seagulls this morning , and we were driving back from my sister's ,  , when she was at work .
_d2981 
_d2981 		Lily said seagulls seagulls , and there's like a +...
_d2981 
_d2981 		I don't know , some sort of +... 
_d2981 		like a dental office or something like that that's got seagulls on it .
_d2981 
_d2981 		xxx .
_d2981 
_d2981 		are you so smart ?
_d2981 
_d2981 		yeah .
_d2981 
_d2981 		xxx .
_d2981 
_d2981 		Paddington looked around anxiously as Mister Brown began laying out beach things . 
_d2981 		I hope the air doesn't get used up , Missus Brown , he said in a loud voice .
_d2981 
_d2981 		and he gave a man doing deep breathing exercises a very hard stare indeed . 
_d2981 		come on Paddington , called Judy , let's go for a swim . 
_d2981 		it took Paddington quite a while to get ready . 
_d2981 		he wasn't the sort of bear who believed in taking chances , and by the time he went into the sea , he was wearing so many things he promptly sank .
_d2981 
_d2981 		no wonder , cried Judy , you haven't even bothered to blow up your paw+bands . 
_d2981 		fancy wearing a duffel coat in the water , exclaimed Jonathan . 
_d2981 		I thought the water might be cold , said Paddington . 
_d2981 		after his paw+bands had been properly blown up , Paddington went in the water again . 
_d2981 		and with some help from Jonathan and Judy he was soon swimming very well indeed . 
_d2981 		oh , she's got a lollipop .
_d2981 
_d2981 		Paddington had barely closed his eyes when he had heard something very strange going on behind him . 
_d2981 		first there was a loud cry . 
_d2981 		then there were the sound of people booing . 
_d2981 		Paddington jumped up +/.
_d2981 
_d2981 		lollipop .
_d2981 
_d2981 		jumped up and looked at the others as if he could hardly believe his ears . 
_d2981 		but Mister and Missus Brown seemed much too busy with the picnic things to be bothered .
_d2981 
_d2981 		oh who's got the ice cream cone ?
_d2981 
_d2981 		xxx .
_d2981 
_d2981 		where's Paddington asked Jonathan when he and Judy arrived back shortly afterwards carrying ice cream cones and an ice stick . 
_d2981 		I hope he's not long said Judy , I brought him a special cone . 
_d2981 		he'll be most upset if it melts . 
_d2981 		the Browns gave a gasp as they turned to follow the direction of Jonathan's gaze . 
_d2981 		something very odd seemed to be going on inside the Punch and Judy tent . 
_d2981 		there was a large bulge on one side , and it was heaving up and down almost as if it were alive . 
_d2981 		suddenly the tent began moving across the sand , scattering people in all directions . 
_d2981 		it just missed a large sand castle , went twice around the ice cream man and headed toward sea . 
_d2981 		quick shouted Judy , let's cut it off . 
_d2981 		but it was too late . 
_d2981 		Paddington , cried Judy as a familiar face swam into view . 
_d2981 		what on earth are you doing ? 
_d2981 		that's the second time I've had to rescue you .
_d2981 
_d2981 		Paddington stared at her in amazement . 
_d2981 		but I went to rescue you , he said .
_d2981 
_d2981 		seagulls .
_d2981 
_d2981 		Missus Brown said you were being punched by Mister Briggs . 
_d2981 		Missus Brown +/.
_d2981 
_d2981 		seagulls .
_d2981 
_d2981 		Missus Brown looked at Paddington in astonishment .
_d2981 
_d2981 		and then her face cleared .
_d2981 
_d2981 		I didn't say Mister Briggs was punching Judy , I said it was his Punch and Judy . 
_d2981 		it's a puppet theater said Judy . 
_d2981 		they often have them at the seaside . 
_d2981 		there's one puppet called Mister Punch , and when he gets cross all the audience has to boo . 
_d2981 		a lollipop .
_d2981 
_d2981 		if it took the Browns a long time to explain a Punch and Judy show to Paddington , it took them even longer to explain Paddington to Mister Briggs . 
_d2981 		but when he saw the enormous crowd watching his face lit up . 
_d2981 		it was the biggest audience he'd had in a long time , and decided to make the most of it by putting on another show . 
_d2981 		you can have a seat in the front row , he said to Paddington . 
_d2981 		I expect bears do very good boos . 
_d2981 		one way and another Paddington enjoyed his day out at the seaside . 
_d2981 		but all good things come to an end , and when it was time to leave he stood for a moment holding up an empty marmalade jar . 
_d2981 		I'm just collecting some sea air for the journey home , he said . 
_d2981 		yay .
_d2981

_d2982 
_d2982 		you know some of them +...
_d2982 
_d2982 		yeah  .

_d2982 		you wanna read Sam ?
_d2982 
_d2982 		which should we read first , Sam or cookies ?
_d2982 
_d2982 		Sam ?
_d2982 
_d2982 		don't you feel well Sam ? 
_d2982 		it was a cold cold night on plum street . 
_d2982 		in the little white house , Missus Bear was putting Sam to bed . 
_d2982 		she closed their favorite book and they both blew out the candle . 
_d2982 		xxx , kiss goodnight Sam , Missus Bear said , and she wrapped him all cozy in the blanket that was red . 
_d2982 		but suddenly , she heard a cough . 
_d2982 		what does a cough sound like ? 
_d2982 		and there sat Sam , curled up and small , and coughing in his bed .
_d2982 
_d2982 		Missus Bear put her arms around Sam . 
_d2982 		don't you feel well Sam ?
_d2982 
_d2982 		Sam shook his head ,   . 
_d2982 		poor Saam . 
_d2982 		Missus Brown hugged him harder and kissed his warm cheek .
_d2982 
_d2982 		you have a cough , she said , and she dashed down the stairs , and up again with +...
_d2982 
_d2982 		the cough syrup .
_d2982 
_d2982 		open wide Sam , she said . 
_d2982 		Sam shook his head .
_d2982 
_d2982 		tastes bad , he said .
_d2982 
_d2982 		yes , said his Mama , you need to be brave . 
_d2982 		Sam put the blanket on his head . 
_d2982 		I don't have a cough ,   . 
_d2982 		try again Sam , said his Mama . 
_d2982 		Sam shook the blanket off his head .
_d2982 
_d2982 		he opened up , then closed his mouth tight . 
_d2982 		the spoon was too big .
_d2982

_d3025 		Norman . 
_d3025 		okay . 
_d3025 		okay . 
_d3025 		in front of a small well hidden hole . 
_d3025 		around and back of the majestic museum of art there once stood a mouse named ? 
_d3025 		Norman . 
_d3025 		Norman was a doorman . 
_d3025 		he greeted all the art loving creatures .
_d3025 
_d3025 		she's wearing a dress . 
_d3025 		you're right .
_d3025 
_d3025 		you're right .
_d3025 
_d3025 		oh I think he's wearing a lil [: little] scarf . 
_d3025 		on his neck . 
_d3025 		he greeted all the art loving creatures . 
_d3025 		who came to see the treasures . 
_d3025 		which were kept in the basement of the museum . 
_d3025 		come right in Norman would say .
_d3025 
_d3025 		a lil [: little] scarf . 
_d3025 		and a dress . 
_d3025 		right ? 
_d3025 		right a scarf . 
_d3025 		we're quite safe said Norman I sprung all the traps .
_d3025 
_d3025 		a bust .
_d3025 
_d3025 		we saw a white bust in the museum here right . 
_d3025 		Norman would explain every painting in detail . 
_d3025 		and handle each masterpiece masterpiece with as much care +...
_d3025 
_d3025 		a sad clown and a statue you're right . 
_d3025 		he handled each masterpiece with as much care and respect as if he had painted it himself . 
_d3025 		he would also take great pride in pointing out the artistic features of certain pieces of Greek sculpture . 
_d3025 		which rested in the dark corners of the storage room . 
_d3025 		she is wearing quite a snazzy dress I think . 
_d3025 		as  we missed a page . 
_d3025 		Norman's only worry was keeping out of sight of the sharp eyed upstairs guard . 
_d3025 		who often came to the basement to set traps for mice . 
_d3025 		his bright flashlight frightened the visitors .
_d3025 
_d3025 		I know they're running away from the guard . 
_d3025 		yeah .
_d3025 
_d3025 		as for Norman he always managed to escape . 
_d3025 		and hide inside an old armored knights helmet . 
_d3025 		up there he felt perfectly safe . 
_d3025 		actually the helmet was Norman's home . 
_d3025 		which he had made into a very comfortable and workable studio . 
_d3025 		just see what a splendid sky light the visor made . 
_d3025 		like most everybody Norman had a hobby . 
_d3025 		each night after work he tried to create something pleasing or beautiful . 
_d3025 		perhaps a painting of swiss cheese and crackers or a statue . 
_d3025 		one bitter cold day Norman decided to stay in his studio and make something out of wire . 
_d3025 		I know he's making something out of wire . 
_d3025 		it's a mouse trap . 
_d3025 		he took it apart .
_d3025 
_d3025 		and he's taking the wire off of it to make a sculpture right ?
_d3025 		right .
_d3025 
_d3025 		he made a trapeze . 
_d3025 		that's right . 
_d3025 		all through the day and far into the night Norman twisted and bent wires into many strange and mysterious shapes . 
_d3025 		until at last he created something he was really proud of . 
_d3025 		it looked for all the world like a mouse on a trapeze . 
_d3025 		oh yes . 
_d3025 		that night when he finally went to sleep he was a tired but happy mouse . 
_d3025 		early next morning when Norman went outside to shovel away snow in front of his doorway . 
_d3025 		he noticed a man reading a sign nearby . 
_d3025 		he read the sign to . 
_d3025 		sculpture contest . 
_d3025 		open to all artists great and small . 
_d3025 		last day today . 
_d3025 		back he flew . 
_d3025 		why can't I show my wire statue he said . 
_d3025 		as he slid through the visor opening . 
_d3025 		but what would he call it . 
_d3025 		all pieces must have a title he well knew . 
_d3025 		suddenly he had an inspiration . 
_d3025 		trapeze . 
_d3025 		now he had a fitting title for his wire work . 
_d3025 		although Norman was a modest mouse he practically burst a button off his coat . 
_d3025 		then as this was the last day for artists to bring their sculpture pieces . 
_d3025 		Norman put a cover over his statue as he +...
_d3025 
_d3025 		there the mouse is hiding there under the cover . 
_d3025 		up the snowy staircase he climbed . 
_d3025 		once inside the huge museum he eagerly followed the other sculptors from one room to another . 
_d3025 		he still had to be extremely careful of the guard .
_d3025 
_d3025 		there's a bust you're right . 
_d3025 		the other bust is sad ? 
_d3025 		yes . 
_d3025 		the accordion right . 
_d3025 		you're right . 
_d3025 		it's an accordion . 
_d3025 		what's this ? 
_d3025 		is that a statue of a woman dancing ? 
_d3025 		yeah .
_d3025 
_d3025 		she looks like she's having a good time . 
_d3025 		don't you think ? 
_d3025 		yes . 
_d3025 		and there's a statue of a man riding a horse . 
_d3025 		and a statue of a lil [: little] boy and girl holding a balloon . 
_d3025 		after carefully removing the cover from his wire statue he left it on the floor with the rest of the contestants work . 
_d3025 		out he went into the snowy afternoon knowing he had done his best . 
_d3025 		you see he had not forgotten he was a doorman who had a job to do . 
_d3025 		she is wearing a dress . 
_d3025 		what color is her dress ?
_d3025 
_d3025 		oh another dress . 
_d3025 		wow .
_d3025 
_d3025 		two dresses what color are they ? 
_d3025 		yellow and pink . 
_d3025 		meanwhile upstairs in the sculpture gallery of the museum . 
_d3025 		the judges were busy judging . 
_d3025 		oh ! 
_d3025 		there it is . 
_d3025 		quietly and seriously they examined each piece . 
_d3025 		trying to find which ones deserved prizes . 
_d3025 		gradually they found themselves huddled around a certain statue . 
_d3025 		now this is an [: and] amazing creation exclaimed one . 
_d3025 		there's no name and isn't it a shame it's so tiny . 
_d3025 		yes but remember the contest is open to great and small . 
_d3025 		one by one each guard when asked if he had knew who had brought it in shook his head and said no not I . 
_d3025 		the museum director couldn't understand why none of them had caught sight of the artist . 
_d3025 		but when the sharp eyed guard took a closer look he gasped . 
_d3025 		so this is where my mouse traps have been going . 
_d3025 		I think I know where to start looking for that tricky trap snatcher . 
_d3025 		and without waiting another minute the guard snapped on his flash light and hurried downstairs to the basement . 
_d3025 		what's this one of my traps stuck in a knights helmet . 
_d3025 		he lifted up the visor to investigate . 
_d3025 		there inside he saw pieces of wire and parts of traps . 
_d3025 		and strangest of all a neat straw bed which could only belong to a mouse . 
_d3025 		whoever he is he must be very find of my cheese said the guard . 
_d3025 		during all this time Norman had been tending to his duty as a doorman . 
_d3025 		a party of mice from the country for whom he had be waiting . 
_d3025 		was long passed due . 
_d3025 		and he was getting mighty cold and hungry . 
_d3025 		but to his surprise who should come around the corner but the sharp eyed guard . 
_d3025 		there you are said the guard as Norman flad inside . 
_d3025 		but when the guard held a piece of cheese above the hole Norman sniffed it . 
_d3025 		and just as he was about to reach up and snatch the cheese a hand came around swiftly and caught Norman by the tail . 
_d3025 		are you the rascal who's been taking my mouse traps everyday and using them for artistic purposes asked the guard . 
_d3025 		it's just my hobby said Norman . 
_d3025 		it's just my hobby . 
_d3025 		oh there having a big party . 
_d3025 		the guard tossed Norman up on his shoulder . 
_d3025 		Norman was sure he was being taken to jail . 
_d3025 		you can imagine his surprise when instead they entered the museum and heard the artist all clapping and cheering hooray for trapeze . 
_d3025 		hooray for trapeze ! 
_d3025 		I do believe you've won a prize . 
_d3025 		the guard rushed right up to the judges platform and said proudly . 
_d3025 		here's the winner I found him freezing in the snow . 
_d3025 		indeed said the head judge . 
_d3025 		why yes who else would could have created the daring mouse on the trapeze . 
_d3025 		what is your name my good fellow ? 
_d3025 		and what would you like for your prize ? 
_d3025 		if you please sir my name is Norman . 
_d3025 		and I'm the doorman downstairs . 
_d3025 		and I've always dreamed of seeing the upstairs of the museum without getting caught . 
_d3025 		that's what I'd like best . 
_d3025 		there's a bust . 
_d3025 		and another bust .
_d3025 
_d3025 		and that's (.) that's a knight with his armor on . 
_d3025 		yes .
_d3025 
_d3025 		the guard led Norman out into the hall . 
_d3025 		where together they began a grand tour of the entire art museum . 
_d3025 		later that night when Norman returned from returned to his door . 
_d3025 		he found his mice friends from the country waiting for him . 
_d3025 		of course Norman invited them in where he shared with them an enormous slice of cheese . 
_d3025 		a present given to him from the warm hearted guard . 
_d3025 		what a wonderful way to end the day . 
_d3025 		good night .

_d3026 		and so pregnant women or people planning to get pregnant shouldn't eat that much tuna and young children and whatever . 
_d3026 		so she loves it . 
_d3026 		so  although not with mayonnaise . 
_d3026 		only eats tuna in olive oil . 
_d3026 		like she eats italian tuna in olive oil and salt . 
_d3026 		I know . 
_d3026 		oh she wearing a dress too ? 
_d3026 		so I called I kept meaning to ask the pediatrician and I forgot to ask her when we were there for our two year appointment . 
_d3026 		so I called one day and it's a big practice . 
_d3026 		and you know a bunch of doctors running around . 
_d3026 		told her I was a patient of Dr Louis I was wondering if you could ask +...
_d3026 
_d3026 		yes sweetie pie . 
_d3026 		okay sweetie mommy has Hondo and Fabian to if you wanna read it . 
_d3026 		oh .
_d3026 
_d3026 		you wanna read that one ? 
_d3026 		okay . 
_d3026 		oh I'm sorry angel . 
_d3026 		I'm sorry . 
_d3026 		did I just scratch your lil [: little] nose ? 
_d3026 		can I kiss it ?
_d3026 
_d3026 		does that feel better ? 
_d3026 		oh good . 
_d3026 		so I call up and I said can you ask if there's does the practice have any guide+lines as to how much tuna a kid can eat ?
_d3026 
_d3026 		(be)cause she wants everyday for lunch can we have tuna ? 
_d3026 		so I've only been I've been trying to give it to her once a week . 
_d3026 		and she'll eat like a three ounce can . 
_d3026 		but even that I'm like it's so hard to wait a whole week to give it to her (be)cause she wants it . 
_d3026 		wow . 
_d3026 		and  so I called and the woman's like okay I'll ask like you're crazy .
_d3026 
_d3026 		she gets back on the phone she goes Dr Lang said one to two ounces a week (.) like that's like two bites an ounce .
_d3026 
_d3026 		I know . 
_d3026 		so the woman goes my son eats tuna everyday .
_d3026 
_d3026 		so this is what they're recommending for (.) that an adult female shouldn't have like should have a can (be)cause a big a regular size can of tuna is six ounces . 
_d3026 		yeah . 
_d3026 		so they said a grown woman can have a can of tuna a week and young kids are suppose to have one to two .
_d3026 
_d3026 		I know . 
_d3026 		I eat it too . 
_d3026 		I eat so much tuna . 
_d3026 		I know . 
_d3026 		I mean I think it's only related to pregnancy .
_d3026 
_d3026 		and young kids but I guess the mercury will affect brain development . 
_d3026 		potentially . 
_d3026 		you know they said canned tuna has less than fresh tuna it's really I guess it's tuna and swordfish that your suppose to cut back on .
_d3026 
_d3026 		but one to two if they're really suggesting one to two ounces a week I can't believe that they don't hand this out on a flyer to people .
_d3026 
_d3026 		she would literally eat it everyday if she could .
_d3026 
_d3026 		I know literally the small the tiny can with the flip .
_d3026 
_d3026 		top that you'll buy for lunch that comes with crackers or whatever .
_d3026 
_d3026 		that's three ounces and it's like this big tiny . 
_d3026 		so they're saying this for adult pregnant woman . 
_d3026 		right or anyone who can potentially become pregnant . 
_d3026 		right .
