_t4 		when he heard the crash , he came dashing down the escalator . 
_t4 		now who in the world did that , he said . 
_t4 		somebody must be hiding around here . 
_t4 		he flashed his light around sofas and beds until he came to the biggest bed of all . 

_t4 		who was it ? 
_t4 		who's that hiding ? 
_t4 		Corduroy .
_t4 
_t4 		hello , he said .

_t4 		and put him on a shelf in the toy department with all the other animals and dolls . 
_t4 		what are they doing , Ethan ?
