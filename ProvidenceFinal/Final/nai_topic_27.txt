_t4 		where can we tie it here in the living room ? 

_t4 		lemme [: let me] get a big piece of twine . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		let's a , let's clip that on to you . 

_t4 		now the other thing we need to do is to find the  +... 
_t4 		doll clothes . 
_t4 		why don't you put these things  +... 
_t4 		over where the +... 
_t4 		here this too . 
_t4 		where the tool box is . 
_t4 		that's where those things belong . 
_t4 		they belong with the tool+box . 
_t4 		well , we're straightening up so that you have room . 
_t4 		to put the +... 
_t4 		doll clothes .
_t4 
_t4 		hanging up there with the +...
_t4 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		can you just , why don't you practice by just putting a clothes+pin on that line . 
_t4 		can you do that ? 
_t4 		do it the same way you do it on the box , you have_to hold the top of the clothes+pin . 
_t4 		push . 
_t4 		and then clip . 
_t4 		can I show you ? 
_t4 		okay watch my fingers , push ! 
_t4 		there yeah , and it hangs upside down like that .
_t4 
_t4 		okay , the way you take it off +... 
_t4 		push ! 
_t4 		and there . 
_t4 		okay , what +...
_t4 
_t4 		find the doll clothes , you need to find them before you hang them up . 
_t4 		here's something to hang up . 
_t4 		where are the rest of the doll clothes ? 
_t4 		for hanging up . 
_t4 		seems to me you need to find some more . 
_t4 		okay , this is what we're gonna do . 
_t4 		put it here and now you can push . 
_t4 		just like you did it on the box the same way , but you have_to point it down . 
_t4 		it's upside down . 
_t4 		okay watch Mommy do it . 
_t4 		push . 
_t4 		and clip . 
_t4 		and this is gonna move but that's okay . 
_t4 		it doesn't matter . 
_t4 		you need to use words to say what you want .
_t4 
_t4 		put it up right ? 
_t4 		it doesn't matter .
_t4 
_t4 		we can't put it up right because the twine is too small . 
_t4 		if it were thicker twine then it would stay up right I think . 
_t4 		oh yeah ? 
_t4 		do you wanna get some more doll clothes and hang them up to dry ? 
_t4 		why don't you look in your room and see if there's some in there ? 

_t4 		want me to hold the clothes up for you ? 
_t4 		yeah , you were doing a good job . 
_t4 		okay . 

_t4 		Akmak . 
_t4 		that's the kinda [: kind of] crackers they are . 

_t4 		he says how did you get up here ? 
_t4 		why does he say that ? 
_t4 		yeah , Corduroy went up the escalator all by himself ! 
_t4 		that's very strange for a little bear to do that all by himself . 
_t4 		or herself .
_t4 
_t4 		(be)cause bears don't usually walk around department stores all by themselves after dark . 
_t4 		they might get lost ! 
_t4 		he did get a little bit lost , didn't he ? 
_t4 		yes .
_t4 
_t4 		he was trying to look for the button . 
_t4 		well +...
_t4 
_t4 		umm , because he knows that the people who are in the store who want to buy a little bear he hears them say that they want bears who don't have lost buttons , they want bears who already have their buttons . 
_t4 		let's see here +... 
_t4 		wow , you polished that right up didn't you ? 
_t4 		hungry girl ! 
_t4 		here's a bit more ! 
_t4 		oh boy ! 
_t4 		you like that , huh ? 
_t4 		that's how the akh makh is made . 
_t4 		it's made with sesame seeds on it . 
_t4 		that's just how it's made . 
_t4 		did you have fun this morning ? 
_t4 		where did we go ? 

_t4 		whose house did we go to ? 
_t4 		xxx house . 
_t4 		that was fun . 
_t4 		and you wanted to see what his high+chair looked like . 
_t4 		and you saw it . 

_t4 		that's a very good question . 
_t4 		I will write it down on our question sheet right now . 
_t4 		our list of questions . 
_t4 		what do ducks eat ? 
_t4 		I dunno [: don't know] , I'm gonna find out for you . 
_t4 		they live near the water . 

_t4 		rivers .
_t4 
_t4 		oh . 
_t4 		just from lakes . 
_t4 		I think we should go to Cape Cod Natural Foods . 
_t4 		when you're done with your snack .
_t4 
_t4 		so that we can buy more smoothie . 
_t4 		because +... 
_t4 		(be)cause +... 

_t4 		it's all gone ! 
_t4 		well , how (a)bout drinking more smoothie ? 
_t4 		I heard you say that . 
_t4 		but  a smoothie is for drinking , not for washing . 
_t4 		it just is . 
_t4 		okay , Mommy's gonna make chili tonight . 
_t4 		to eat , chili is a food we eat , it's spicy beans . 
_t4 		yeah ?
_t4 
_t4 		what ? 
_t4 		you're a silly+willy ? 
_t4 		who's a silly+willy ? 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm , I'm cutting . 
_t4 		hot peppers here . 
_t4 		I'm gonna freeze these hot peppers . 

_t4 		use a little more of them now . 
_t4 		I'm cutting those hot peppers . 
_t4 		well , they're very very hot and spicy so I don't wanna +... 
_t4 		cause you to sneeze excessively . 

_t4 		wanna keep healthy . 
_t4 		I'm not eating anything right now . 
_t4 		I'm just drinking orange juice . 
_t4 		there's no Daddy down+stairs . 
_t4 		you know where he is and what he's doing I think . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		he's gonna help people feel better . 
_t4 		patients . 
_t4 		what do you think ? 
_t4 		you know the answer to that question . 
_t4 		he's gonna check their hearts , oops . 
_t4 		well , I just realized that your bib and your microphone fell down . 
_t4 		some time ago , perhaps . 
_t4 		there . 
_t4 		he's gonna listen to their hearts with a stethoscope . 
_t4 		what else does he do to help them feel better Naima ? 
_t4 		he looks in their ears with an otoscope ? 
_t4 		I don't think he does that a lot , but I think once in a while maybe he does that . 
_t4 		he figures out what kind of medicine they need . 
_t4 		I'm cooking onions and garlic . 
_t4 		and green hot spicy peppers . 
_t4 		(be)cause I'm making chili . 
_t4 		and chili's also gonna have black+beans in it . 
_t4 		and tomatoes . 
_t4 		and we're gonna eat it for supper later on . 
_t4 		you'll have chili . 
_t4 		well right now it's just onions , it's not that interesting . 

_t4 		your hand's [: hand is] going away ? 
_t4 		oh , it's very dark outside isn't it ? 
_t4 		I think it's overcast .
_t4 
_t4 		you think it's gonna snow or rain ? 
_t4 		it doesn't really snow in the summer . 
_t4 		just summer is not a time when there's snow . 
_t4 		winter , fall and spring are the only time when it snows . 
_t4 		uhh  house . 

_t4 		he wanted to touch you and give you hugs . 
_t4 		and he actually give you a kiss on your back , he's a very sneaky kisser . 
_t4 		he likes to sneak up behind people and kiss them on the back of their head . 
_t4 		well he's little . 
_t4 		he's a little bit shy , I think +... 
_t4 		oh ,  . 
_t4 		it does fit ? 
_t4 		no .
_t4 
_t4 		what's not working ? 
_t4 		oh .
