_t4 		the mommy is: +... 
_t4 		changing the baby's diaper .

_t4 		should we take a potty with us on our journey ? 
_t4 		yea:ah [: yes] . 
_t4 		maybe (be)cause she's too short and he's tall enough to reach . 
_t4 		which potty do you think we should take with us on the journey , should we take this potty seat and leave these two at home ? 
_t4 		okay we could bring the bunny potty .

_t4 		way up like that . 
_t4 		good ! 
_t4 		you did . 
_t4 		and then you fold the whole thing up . 
_t4 		fold both triangles up . 
_t4 		like that . 
_t4 		and then you tape that part . 
_t4 		and you attach this flap +//.
_t4 		this is like a flap isn't it ? 
_t4 		you attach the flap . 
_t4 		to the present with the tape . 
_t4 		and then +... 
_t4 		you turn it all the way around gently . 
_t4 		so that this is the edge that you make the triangles on now . 
_t4 		so: let's make triangles here . 
_t4 		one here +... 
_t4 		we:ll (.) let go for a sec . 
_t4 		take the corner . 
_t4 		bring it up to where the edge of the present inside the wrapping is . 
_t4 		and then what do you do , d(o) you remember ? 
_t4 		you bring this edge wa:y up . 
_t4 		oka:y yeah .
_t4 		that's right . 
_t4 		yeah and then tape . 
_t4 		le(t) me get my tape . 
_t4 		yeah (.) gotta hold it down . 
_t4 		well you  mostly wanna tape the flap to +... 
_t4 		the main part of the present . 
_t4 		to the big part of the present . 
_t4 		so that the flap stays down . 
_t4 		yep [: yes] . 
_t4 		(o)kay . 
_t4 		that's on my finger isn't it ? 
_t4 		here . 
_t4 		good . 
_t4 		(o)kay +//.
_t4 		you don't need too much , just need enough to keep the flap down , it doesn't have_to be +... 
_t4 		well that's okay +//.
_t4 		that amount of sticking up is actually okay . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		now +... 
_t4 		good job +//.
_t4 		turn it (.) so that the tape is on the bottom . 
_t4 		yeah that's the present for Grandma , it look very nice . 
_t4 		now I'm gonna put this box together to wrap the hat and gloves for Grandma . 
_t4 		um (o)kay .
_t4 		this is what +//.
_t4 		the hat I got for my mom . 
_t4 		oh very nice . 
_t4 		and some gloves to match +//.
_t4 		the hat is actually +//.
_t4 		it's wool but it's lined with fleece so it's not scratchy +/.
_t4 		that's very nice . 
_t4 		yes . 
_t4 		I hope +//.
_t4 		I hope she (.) will wear it . 
_t4 		and this is: +... 
_t4 		these are the gloves . 
_t4 		purple gloves . 
_t4 		a:nd I think what I wanna do: +... 
_t4 		is: +... 
_t4 		I wanna +... 
_t4 		no , maybe that won't work . 
_t4 		I guess I'm gonna put the gloves inside the hat . 
_t4 		and then +... 
_t4 		wrap it a little bit like this . 
_t4 		and put it in the box . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		close up the box +//.
_t4 		and then we'll wrap the box in some wrapping paper . 
_t4 		think I'll +... 
_t4 		tape the box just a little bit closed . 
_t4 		to make sure it stays closed . 
_t4 		okay , can you put that tape right there ? 
_t4 		right here . 
_t4 		right at the edge . 
_t4 		yep [: yes] and rub it . 
_t4 		so that closes the box . 
_t4 		now we need wrapping paper . 
_t4 		um: . 
_t4 		um: . 
_t4 		I think we use the gold wrapping paper . 
_t4 		since that seems to be +/.
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		le(t) me see: that's not big enough over there so: +...
_t4 		yep [: yes] you're gonna help but le(t) me cut the right size of paper first . 
_t4 		oh the weather outside is frightful: . 
_t4 		there is but I'm singing it in the wrong +//.
_t4 		with the wrong (.) notes . 
_t4 		because that's a song that I can never remember the right notes to . 
_t4 		okay this is our piece of paper for this box . 
_t4 		do you remember what the first thing we should do is ? 
_t4 		well the first thing we do +... 
_t4 		is we make sure the wrapping paper +//.
_t4 		the nice side of the wrapping paper , the side we want to show , is actually on the floor . 
_t4 		this is the inside that no one's gonna see +//.
_t4 		the white part . 
_t4 		and then we put our present (.) down on the wrapping paper . 
_t4 		and then we have_to do some folding +//.
_t4 		do you remember what we do ? 
_t4 		how do we fold the paper +/?
_t4 		(o)kay your end +//.
_t4 		you take your end of the paper . 
_t4 		well we don't do the triangles just yet . 
_t4 		take both +//.
_t4 		take this in one hand . 
_t4 		and this corner in that hand and bring the +//.
_t4 		bring the paper right up here . 
_t4 		onto the box . 
_t4 		not triangles . 
_t4 		just bring all the paper . 
_t4 		right up onto the box . 
_t4 		and that's what I'm gonna do with my end also +//.
_t4 		I'm holding this one down . 
_t4 		and now I'm bringing up this paper +//.
_t4 		so we're gonna cover +... 
_t4 		here's some tape . 
_t4 		cover the box . 
_t4 		with the paper . 
_t4 		yep [: yes] go ahead and put the (.) tape right there that's good . 
_t4 		and I'll put a piece there and I think we need one more little piece . 
_t4 		right at the end . 
_t4 		good . 
_t4 		nope [: no] we actually don't need more there .
_t4 		the secret to good wrapping is not to use too much tape I think . 
_t4 		now we're gonna make triangles +//.
_t4 		this is a box so it's a little different . 
_t4 		our triangle's gonna look like that . 
_t4 		and like that . 
_t4 		now can you bring this up onto the main part of the box ? 
_t4 		pull up and then over . 
_t4 		it's different from wrapping something flat . 
_t4 		(o)kay I'm holding this , will you put some tape ? 
_t4 		to attach it +//.
_t4 		we don't wanna cover all the edges with tape , we just wanna use +... 
_t4 		a small +... 
_t4 		amount . 
_t4 		teeny tiny pieces of tape . 
_t4 		would you put that one over there ? 
_t4 		goo:d okay . 
_t4 		and I'll put one here . 
_t4 		and now I'm gonna bring it aro:und . 
_t4 		make some triangles on this side . 
_t4 		give you a piece of tape +//.
_t4 		don't use it until I tell you okay ? 
_t4 		where's the triangles . 
_t4 		and then folding it up . 
_t4 		bringing it over . 
_t4 		there . 
_t4 		right on the edge and I'll put one little piece right here too . 
_t4 		and that's done . 
_t4 		well we have a lot more to wrap but we need to make sure we la:bel these and (.) and wrap them with ribbons and things so that +... 
_t4 		uh (.) so that (.) we know who they're for . 
_t4 		(be)cause that's important too , isn't it ? 
_t4 		I wonder if I put all my ribbons and other things in some stra:nge location . 
_t4 		xxx I'm gonna look in the closet over here . 
_t4 		to see if the +... 
_t4 		wrapping paper and the ribbons are +//.
_t4 		somehow got over here by accident . 
_t4 		well it's (.) not there .
_t4 		oh I think that's the supper: that's ready . 
_t4 		I had a lot of ribbon +/.
_t4 		(be)cause  Daddy and I  +... 
_t4 		put supper in the oven to heat up . 
_t4 		just a sec(ond) boo boo . 
_t4 		maybe I put it in here . 
_t4 		nope [: no] I guess not . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		well that's all+right we're just gonna make a little tag for Grandma that says +...

_t4 		one for your picture .
_t4 		the tag for your picture .

_t4 		you can decide where you wanna put it . 
_t4 		decide where on the package you wanna put it . 
_t4 		o:kay .

_t4 		and then I'm gonna write in parentheses , a:nd also +... 
_t4 		from  and  . 
_t4 		and Naima . 
_t4 		and then I'm gonna tape that . 
_t4 		I'm gonna put my tape on a different way +//.
_t4 		I'm gonna fold the tape +... 
_t4 		and make it almost like a piece of glue . 
_t4 		so that this becomes like a sticker . 
_t4 		now: . 
_t4 		these presents can go under the tree . 
_t4 		wanna put them under the tree ? 
_t4 		and carry them over there ?

_t4 		I think that's enough . 
_t4 		uh , we need a coupla [: couple of] other things besides yogurt , not a lot though .
