_d3757 
_d3757 		well but you know what remember last time mommy's glasses broke so I don't think I want donkey to climb on my glasses . 
_d3757 		well (be)cause we don't wanna buy yet another pair of glasses I think daddy would be unhappy if mommy bought yet another pair . 
_d3757 		I seem to go through glasses rather quickly . 
_d3757 		mmmm+hmmm .
_d3757 
_d3758 		don't hurt me donkey . 
_d3758 		oh thanks donkey . 
_d3758 		yeah . 
_d3758 		sweets you wanna read a book ? 
_d3758 		book ? 
_d3758 		should we read a book ? 
_d3758 		wouldjou [: would you] like to pick one out ? 
_d3758 		alright . 
_d3758 		we could also play dominos too if you want . 
_d3758 		wow . 
_d3758 		you'd rather read Dot . 
_d3758 		well okay . 
_d3758 		hi there my name's Dot . 
_d3758 		actually I'm princess Dot next in line to be queen of the whole ant hill . 
_d3758 		of course my sister Ada's [: Ada is] actually queen now so I'll most likely be a princess for a long time . 
_d3758 		don't get me wrong I like being a princess . 
_d3758 		but to be honest with you I'd rather play around and be a member of my blueberry troop then perform royal duties . 
_d3758 		and besides Ada's [: Ada is] a good queen even though she worries a lot . 
_d3758 		she's a whole lot better than she used to be I'll tell you that much . 
_d3758 		when she was a queen in training she used to get upset about everything . 
_d3758 		of course there used to be a lot to get upset over . 
_d3758 		you see our ant hill used to be in a ton of trouble . 
_d3758 		there were these big mean old grasshoppers who would come to collect most of the grain we harvested every year . 
_d3758 		we were all terrified of those grasshoppers . 
_d3758 		they barely left us enough food for ourselves for the winter . 
_d3758 		poor Ada . 
_d3758 		I have_to admit she was stepping up to the throne at a bad time . 
_d3758 		now my friend Flick he's a really cool guy . 
_d3758 		he's an inventor and let me tell you he can invent anything . 
_d3758 		once he made a telescope out of a drop of water that he put inside a rolled up leaf . 
_d3758 		anyway during the last harvest we ever did for the grasshoppers Flick invented a harvesting machine . 
_d3758 		it was really neat but no one except me would listen to him and see what amazing things his machine could do . 
_d3758 		maybe if they had things would've been different . 
_d3758 		one day we heard the grasshoppers arriving so we all ran inside the ant hill Flick was left outside with his invention . 
_d3758 		I told you Flick was cool but I didn't tell you he could be kinda [: kind of] clumsy too . 
_d3758 		he ended up knocking the entire offering of grain over the ledge and into the river below . 
_d3758 		now we were in awfully big trouble . 
_d3758 		the grasshoppers got really mad and even picked me up and threatened to squish me . 
_d3758 		ah that's an ant's worst nightmare . 
_d3758 		ah . 
_d3758 		oh my gosh a nightmare . 
_d3758 		don't squish me . 
_d3758 		no yeah she's just a little princess ant .
_d3758 
_d3758 		don't squish her . 
_d3758 		Flick felt so bad he came up with a plan to make things better . 
_d3758 		what's donkey doing ? 
_d3758 		is he eating your foot ?
_d3758 
_d3758 		really ? 
_d3758 		really ? 
_d3758 		oh it looked like he was nibbling on your toe . 
_d3758 		you're right . 
_d3758 		xxx . 
_d3758 		xxx . 
_d3758 		now he has a necklace on . 
_d3758 		wow . 
_d3758 		oh it looks like a stethoscope . 
_d3758 		well +... 
_d3758 		okay . 
_d3758 		he decided to leave our island to go in search of warrior bugs to protect us . 
_d3758 		no ant had ever left ant island before . 
_d3758 		good luck Flick I shouted as he flew away on a dandelion puff . 
_d3758 		nobody believed he could do it nobody expect me that is . 
_d3758 		you just watch I said . 
_d3758 		he'll get the bestest roughest bugs you've ever seen . 
_d3758 		and guess what ? 
_d3758 		he did . 
_d3758 		well sort of . 
_d3758 		the only problem was that the warrior bugs Flick brought back were actually circus bugs . 
_d3758 		it was a tiny mistake but it could still work out . 
_d3758 		at least I thought it could . 
_d3758 		Flick got the circus bugs and me and my whole blueberry troop to help him with his plan . 
_d3758 		we made a giant fake bird out of leaves and twigs . 
_d3758 		so when the grasshoppers return to get their food we would scare them by crawling inside the bird and flying it right at them . 
_d3758 		it was a daring plan and Flick was great . 
_d3758 		he was like the captain of our ship . 
_d3758 		blueberries ready he asked when we were loaded inside the bird . 
_d3758 		ready we shouted back . 
_d3758 		then whoosh we were flying . 
_d3758 		and we really scared those mean old grasshoppers . 
_d3758 		they thought we were go they were going to get eaten by our bird . 
_d3758 		but then we kinduv [: kind of] crashed . 
_d3758 		none of us got hurt but the grasshoppers figured out what was going on . 
_d3758 		and they realized we weren't a real bird after all . 
_d3758 		but Flick was really brave he had stood up to the grasshoppers and gotten the whole colony to follow him . 
_d3758 		and Ada helped him too together they fought off the biggest meanest grasshopper of them all . 
_d3758 		in the end those mean old grasshoppers were scared away for good especially after a real live bird chased them down . 
_d3758 		in the end the only sad part was that the circus bugs had to leave . 
_d3758 		p+t Flea owner of the circus asked Flick to join them too . 
_d3758 		sure you can't tour with us he asked ? 
_d3758 		but Flick just said sorry my place is here . 
_d3758 		anyway the circus bugs all promised to come back and visit us at our little ant hill . 
_d3758 		and I sure hope they do . 
_d3758 		in the meantime I think Ada has a crush on Flick . 
_d3758 		I mean it's always been totally obvious that he had a crush on her but this is the first time I've seen her let him hold her hand and stuff . 
_d3758 		I guess if I have_to have a brother in law Flick would be my first choice . 
_d3758 		yes . 
_d3758 		hmmm .
_d3758 
_d3758 		anyway I've gotta go now I wanna practice my flying before supper . 
