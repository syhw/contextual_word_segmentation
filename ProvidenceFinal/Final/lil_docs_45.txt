_d3870 		ooh , that's big , ooh    . 
_d3870 		okay . 
_d3870 		the sound of a bell brought their gaze to the rooftops of a village below . 
_d3870 		they could not see from so high above that the village had been through many hard times . 
_d3870 		famine , floods , and war had made the villagers weary and untrusting of strangers . 
_d3870 		they had even become suspicious of their neighbors . 
_d3870 		the villagers worked hard , but only for themselves . 
_d3870 		there was a farmer , a tea merchant , a scholar , a seamstress , a doctor , a carpenter , and many others . 
_d3870 		but they had little to do with one another .
_d3870 
_d3870 		that's the farmer .
_d3870 
_d3870 		the tea merchant . 
_d3870 		the scholar , which is like a teacher . 
_d3870 		that's the carpenter . 
_d3870 		the seamstress . 
_d3870 		and the doctor . 
_d3870 		when the monks reached the foot of the mountain , the villagers disappeared into their houses . 
_d3870 		no one came to the gates to greet them . 
_d3870 		and when the people saw them enter the village , they closed their windows tight . 
_d3870 		the monks knocked on the door of the first house . 
_d3870 		there was no answer . 
_d3870 		then the house went dark . 
_d3870 		they knocked on a second door and the same thing happened . 
_d3870 		it happened again and again , from one house to the next . 
_d3870 		these people do not know happiness , they all agreed . 
_d3870 		but today , said Siew , his face as bright as the moon , we will show them how to make stone soup . 
_d3870 		they gathered twigs and branches and made a fire . 
_d3870 		they place a small tin pot on top , and filled it with water from the village well . 
_d3870 		a brave little girl who had been watching came to them . 
_d3870 		what are you doing , she asked . 
_d3870 		we're gathering twigs , said Lok . 
_d3870 		we're making a fire , said Hok . 
_d3870 		we're making stone soup , and we need three round , smooth stones , said Siew . 
_d3870 		the little girl helped the monks looked around the courtyard until they found just the right ones . 
_d3870 		then they put them in the water to cook . 
_d3870 		these stones will make excellent soup , said Siew . 
_d3870 		but this very small pot won't make much , I'm afraid . 
_d3870 		my mother has a bigger pot , said the girl . 
_d3870 		the little girl ran home . 
_d3870 		as she started to take her pot , her mother asked what she was doing . 
_d3870 		the three strangers are making soup from stones , she said , they need our biggest pot . 
_d3870 		the monks poked the coals . 
_d3870 		as smoke drifted up , the neighbors peered out from their windows . 
_d3870 		a fire and a huge pot in the middle of the village was a true curiosity . 
_d3870 		of course , old style stone soup should be well seasoned with salt and pepper , said Hok . 
_d3870 		that is true , said Lok , as he stirred the giant pot filled with water and stones . 
_d3870 		but we have none . 
_d3870 		I have some salt and pepper , said the scholar , his eyes big with curiousity . 
_d3870 		he disappeared , and came back with salt and pepper , and even a few other spices . 
_d3870 		Siew took a taste . 
_d3870 		last time we had soup stones of this size and color , carrots made the broth very sweet . 
_d3870 		carrots , said the woman , said a woman from the back , I may have a few carrots . 
_d3870 		but just a few , and off she ran . 
_d3870 		but she returned with as many carrots as she could carry , carry , as she dropped them into the pot . 
_d3870 		think it's gonna be good ?
_d3870 
_d3870 		do you think it would be better with onions , asked Hok . 
_d3870 		oh yes , maybe an onion would taste good , said a farmer , and he hurried off . 
_d3870 		he returned in a moment with five big onions , and he dropped them into the bubbling soup . 
_d3870 		now that's a fine soup , he said . 
_d3870 		the villagers all nodded their heads , as the smell was very agreeable . 
_d3870 		but if only we had some mushrooms , said Siew , rubbing his chin . 
_d3870 		several villagers licked their lips . 
_d3870 		a few dashed away and returned with fresh mushrooms , noodles , pea pods , and carrots . 
_d3870 		oh , sorry , not carrots , cabbages . 
_d3870 		we already have carrots , don't +..?
_d3870 
_d3870 		yeah . 
_d3870 		something magical began to happen among the villagers . 
_d3870 		as each person opened their heart to give , the next person gave even more . 
_d3870 		and as this happened , the soup grew richer , and smelled more delicious . 
_d3870 		I imagine the emperor would suggest we had dumplings , said one villager . 
_d3870 		and bean curds , said another . 
_d3870 		and taro root and winter melon and baby corn , cried the other villagers . 
_d3870 		garlic , ginger root , soy sauce , mini buds !
_d3870 
_d3870 		xxx .
_d3870 
_d3870 		are we gonna put you in the soup ? 
_d3870 		are you a Lily bud ?
_d3870 
_d3870 		you're just a Lily ? 
_d3870 		you're a Lily kid .
_d3870 
_d3870 		do you think we could put you in the soup and eat you up cause [: because] you're so tasty ? 
_d3870 		no ?
_d3870 
_d3870 		oh darn .
_d3870 
_d3870 		there goes my snack .
_d3870 
_d3870 		xxx .
_d3870 
_d3870 		you are so silly . 
_d3870 		I have some , I have some , people cried out , and off they ran , returning with all they could carry . 
_d3870 		the monks stirred , and the pot bubbled . 
_d3870 		how good it smelled . 
_d3870 		how good it would taste , how giving the villagers had become . 
_d3870 		at last , the soup was ready . 
_d3870 		the villagers gathered together . 
_d3870 		everyone sat down to eat . 
_d3870 		they had not been together for a feast like this for as long as anyone could remember . 
_d3870 		after the banquet , they told stories , they sang songs , and they celebrated long into the night . 
_d3870 		then they unlocked their doors and took the monks into their homes and gave them very comfortable places to sleep . 
_d3870 		in the gentle spring morning , everyone gathered together near the willows to say farewell . 
_d3870 		thank you for having us as your guests , said the monks , you have been most generous . 
_d3870 		thank you , said the villagers , with the gifts you have given , we will always have plenty . 
_d3870 		you have shown us that sharing makes us all richer . 
_d3870 		and to think , said the monks , being happy is as simple as making stone soup . 
_d3870 		read this part ? 
_d3870 		stone soup has its traditional roots in European folklore , but there are many versions of the story . 
_d3870 		from France , Sweden , Russia , England , Belgium , there are also related stories from Jamaica , about a soup making pot , and Korea , about a magic cake tree , and the Philippines , about a bill paying hat . 
_d3870 		in this retelling , I took  took the traditional form of the stone soup story and set it in China . 
_d3870 		I also used the Buddhist story tradition , where tricksters spread enlightenment , rather than seeking gain for themselves . 
_d3870 		the characters , Hok , Lok , and Siew , are prominent in Chinese folklore . 
_d3870 		they are three deities that bestow , health , wealth , and prosperity . 
_d3870 		Hok symbolizes good fortune and prosperity . 
_d3870 		Lok symbolizes good health , family happiness , and mutual love . 
_d3870 		Siew symbolizes longevity , and he brings good health , and long life , free from stress and obstacles . 
_d3870 		hmmm   . 
_d3870 		thank you . 
_d3870 		well I don't think I have more applesauce , but we can go to the supermarket and buy more later . 

_d3872 		welcome to Atlantica . 
_d3872 		I'm princess Ariel . 
_d3872 		I'm a mermaid , but my father , king Triton , has a magical trident that can transform me into a +... 
_d3872 		human .
_d3872 
_d3872 		it's as a human that I now live with my husband , prince Eric , in our palace on dry land . 
_d3872 		well how did that happen ? 
_d3872 		oh my gosh , wow . 
_d3872 		my father always told me to stay away from humans , but I was so curious about them . 
_d3872 		one of my favorite things to do was to explore sunken ships . 
_d3872 		my best friend , Flounder , and I found the most wonderful human treasures inside them . 
_d3872 		Daddy said humans were cruel , but I knew that any creature who could make things as beautiful as those crea(tures) , as those treasures couldn't be all bad . 
_d3872 		one day I found something amazing . 
_d3872 		back then , I didn't know anything about the human world . 
_d3872 		but our friend Scuttle , the seagull , did . 
_d3872 		he told us it was a dingle+hopper and that humans used it to comb their hair . 
_d3872 		was he right ?
_d3872 
_d3872 		hmmm .
_d3872 
_d3872 		xxx , you're right , that is so silly .
_d3872 
_d3873 		then , Flounder and I swam to a secret cave where I kept my human treasures . 
_d3873 		I turned on a music box and watched the tiny couple inside dance . 
_d3873 		I wished I could dance and be part of the human world . 
_d3873 		Flounder and I were arranging my treasures when a ship passed overhead . 
_d3873 		we swam up to take a look . 
_d3873 		suddenly , a storm blew in . 
_d3873 		powerful waves pushed the ship closer to the rocks near the shore . 
_d3873 		then , the human they called prince Eric fell overboard ! 
_d3873 		I dove underwater to rescue him , and I was able to pull him to shore . 
_d3873 		I had never been that close to a human before . 
_d3873 		I couldn't take my eyes off of him . 
_d3873 		I was so moved that I started to sing . 
_d3873 		that's when eric opened his eyes . 
_d3874 		we're going to forget this whole thing ever happened , he said . 
_d3874 		later on , Daddy came into my secret cave . 
_d3874 		Sebastian had told him everything . 
_d3874 		Daddy was furious and lectured me about my responsibilities as a princess . 
_d3874 		but I didn't want to be a princess , I wanted to be a human girl . 
_d3874 		Daddy ordered me to stay away from humans , and I told him +/.

_d3881 		Daddy ordered me to stay away from the humans , but I told him I couldn't do that . 
_d3881 		he lowered his trident , and with a single blast , destroyed all of my human treasures . 
_d3881 		I put my head down and cried . 
_d3881 		suddenly , I felt something brush up against my arm . 
_d3881 		at my side were two eels that belonged to the sea witch , Ursula . 
_d3881 		I had heard horrible stories about the sea witch , but I was so upset I didn't care . 
_d3881 		uh  . 
_d3881 		Ursula ? 

_d3881 		uh  , that doesn't look good .
_d3881 
_d3881 		she told me I would stay a human if prince Eric kissed me before the sunset on the third day .
_d3881 
_d3881 		don't what ? 
_d3881 		oh . 
_d3881 		uh  .
_d3881 
_d3881 		it doesn't look good .
_d3881 
_d3881 		I thought about what Daddy had said , but I was determined to see prince Eric again .
_d3881 
_d3882 		as soon as I signed the contract , my voice flowed into Ursula's seashell which was tied around her neck . 
_d3882 		uh  .
_d3882 
_d3882 		things are getting worse and worse !
_d3882 
_d3882 		I sat in the water and stared at my new legs . 
_d3882 		they were amazing . 
_d3882 		when I stood up , I felt so heavy . 
_d3882 		walking was very different from swimming or floating in the water . 
_d3882 		I was really a human . 
_d3882 		everyone disapproved of what I had done . 
_d3882 		only Scuttle was excited for me . 
_d3882 		Ursula is bad news , scolded Sebastian . 
_d3882 		but it was too late for a warning . 
_d3882 		my friends had to help me find the prince , if not , I'd become Ursula's slave ! 
_d3882 		uh o:h .
_d3882

_d3882 		xxx . 
_d3882 		luckily , prince Eric found me on the beach .
_d3882 
_d3882 		you seem very familiar , he said .
_d3882 
_d3882 		I wanted to tell him I was the one who had rescued him , but I couldn't speak . 
_d3882 		he led me to his palace . 
_d3882 		it felt strange to walk , but the prince held me tightly and helped me with each step . 
_d3882 		his servant showed me to my room and I put on a pink gown . 
_d3882 		at dinner , prince Eric told me I looked beautiful . 
_d3882 		I smiled dreamily . 
_d3882 		it seemed like everything was falling into place . 
_d3882 		the next day , Eric and I went out on his rowboat . 
_d3882 		Eric stopped the boat in a lagoon . 
_d3882 		there , he leaned over to me , and just as we were about to kiss , splash ! 
_d3882 		the boat flipped over . 
_d3882 		the kiss would have_to wait . 
_d3882 		oh no !

_d3882 		what is going on ?
_d3882 
_d3882 		this does not look good !
_d3882 
_d3883 		I heard him say , our wedding ship departs at sunset . 
_d3883 		I was crushed , Eric was going to marry Vanessa ! 
_d3883 		what had gone wrong ? 
_d3883 		what ? 
_d3883 		I'd been certain that Eric had the same feelings for me as I did for him , but now it was too late !
_d3883 
_d3883 		but Scuttle flew over and said , I saw the bride in the mirror , Vanessa is Ursula in disguise .
_d3883 
_d3883 		egads .
_d3883 
_d3883 		now I understood , Ursula had tricked Eric into marrying her .
_d3883 
_d3883 		while Flounder pulled me onto the ship , Scuttle and some other sea creatures swam ahead and interrupted the wedding , dropping things on Vanessa and spraying her with water . 
_d3883 		Scuttle snatched the necklace from Vanessa , which fell to the ground and shattered , and my voice flowed back to me . 
_d3883 		and as loudly as I could , I yelled , Eric ! 
_d3883 		you're the one , said Eric , it was you all the time . 
_d3883 		Eric leaned in to kiss me . 
_d3883 		it's too late , Vanessa shrieked . 
_d3883 		the sun had just dropped below the horizon . 
_d3883 		suddenly , as I changed back into a mermaid , Vanessa changed back into Ursula . 
_d3883 		she is so creepy .
_d3883 
_d3883 		Ursula took me to my father and showed him the contract . 
_d3883 		I might be willing to make an exchange , Ursula said , and Daddy agreed , and took my place as Ursula's slave . 
_d3883 		xxx .
_d3883 
_d3883 		it's so sad .

_d3883 		I had to save Daddy and the kingdom , so I followed Ursula . 
_d3883 		oh no !
_d3883 
_d3884 		but while I distracted Ursula , Eric grabbed the wheel of the ship , and steered the bow right into Ursula's cold heart . 
_d3884 		we had defeated the evil sea witch ! 
_d3884 		yay !
_d3884 
_d3884 		oh look , what happens .
_d3884 
_d3884 		Daddy was free , and he forgave me for my selfishness . 
_d3884 		he also realized how much I loved Eric . 
_d3884 		he touched the water with his trident , and transformed my tail into legs again . 
_d3884 		with his blessing , Eric and I were married , and lived happily ever after . 
