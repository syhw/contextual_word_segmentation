_d3689 		huh what's that ? 
_d3689 		a wooly+mammoth . 
_d3689 		wow . 

_d3689 		wooly+mammoths were a type of prehistoric elephant the wooly+mammoth which was distinguished by its long shaggy hair was almost thirteen feet tall . 
_d3689 		and appeared about two million years ago during the ice+age (.) of the pleistocene epoch . 
_d3689 		right ? 
_d3689 		looks similar . 
_d3689 		right . 
_d3689 		because it had a thick layer of fat under its skin as well as abundant hair the wooly+mammoth managed to keep warm in the year+round winter  . 
_d3689 		xxx . 
_d3689 		crash . 
_d3689 		yeah I think so . 
_d3689 		the mammoth lost relatively little body heat through it's ears +/. 
_d3689 		boom . 
_d3689 		it's ears were very small . 
_d3689 		it's long curved tusks enabled it to find food by clearing away snow and ice . 
_d3689 		wooly+mammoths have been found preserved in the frozen tundra of Siberia . 
_d3689 		prehistoric man who probably hunted them for food decorated caves with drawings of these magnificent animals . 
_d3689 		wow .
_d3689 
_d3689 		very long . 
_d3689 		huh who's this ? 

_d3690 		this group included many different kinds of cats all of which had long fangs in their upper jaws . 

_d3690 		exact . 

_d3690 		it woulduv [: would have] used its trunk as an elephant does today to obtain food and water . 

_d3692 		um this one says +/. 
_d3692 		that one says the wooly hair has the wooly+mammoth has long shaggy hair and is just thirteen feet tall . 
_d3692 		this one says the saber+tooth tiger has long pointy fangs . 
_d3692 		xxx . 
_d3692 		this one says the machrauchenia has a long trunk+like nose . 
_d3692 		xxx . 
_d3692 		the brontatherium says that the brontatherium ate leaves and fruit from the trees . 
_d3692 		the thorahockis says that the birds could not fly they ran on their feet . 
_d3692 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_d3692 
_d3692 		the machrauchenia says I have a long nose . 
_d3692 		it says that the machrauchenia was eleven feet tall and looked like a camel with no humps . 
_d3692 		the brontatherium says that they had horns and they used to fight each other with their horns . 
_d3692 		this one says that there were lots_of unusual creatures (.) that roamed the earth many many years ago . 
_d3692 		it says the wolly+mammoth had pretty small ears . 
_d3692 		that says that the wooly+mammoth lived during the ice+age . 
_d3692 		it says that one of the saber+tooth tigers was called a smiladon . 
_d3692 		it had long knife like teeth which were over six inches long . 

_d3692 		the thorahockis says it was about five feet tall and had a long neck and small wings . 
_d3692 		because the wings were so small they could not use them to fly instead the wings may have helped the bird to maintain balance while it ran on its powerful legs . 
_d3692 		yummy . 
_d3692 		huh the giant sloth had long curved claws and fed by stripping leaves with its tongue . 
_d3692 		but when the giant sloth was on the ground its claws forced the animal to walk on the sides of its feet making movement difficult . 
_d3692 		yeah . 

_d3705 		yeah . 
_d3705 		right . 
_d3705 		you're right . 
_d3705 		thi is the tooth+fairy . 
_d3705 		she has lots_of teeth . 
_d3705 		she has lots_of dimes and quarters too . 
_d3705 		she needs them because when you are asleep she comes and takes away the tooth that you have put under your pillow . 
_d3705 		and she puts the money there instead . 
_d3705 		sometimes she forgets and then of course your tooth is still there in the morning instead of the money . 
_d3705 		that this is because she works so hard . 
_d3705 		the tooth+fairy has to work harder than the Easter bunny because the Easter bunny only works on Easter . 
_d3705 		the tooth+fairy works harder than Santa Claus because there's only one night when Santa goes down all those chimneys but the tooth+fairy is busy every night . 
_d3705 		that's Santa with a big sack of toys . 
_d3705 		if she forgets to take your tooth one night she usually remembers it the next . 
_d3705 		she will take your tooth home with her along with all the others she has collected that night . 
_d3705 		when she gets home the first thing she does with your teeth is to sort them . 
_d3705 		lower teeth extra teeth bottom teeth teeny teeth very clean teeth . 
_d3705 		girl's teeth boy's teeth shiny teeth first teeth small teeth . 
_d3705 		she puts some of the pretty ones in a glass jar on a high shelf in the kitchen she thinks they look nice there . 
_d3705 		they do look nice there don't they ? 
_d3705 		yeah . 
_d3705 		pretty . 
_d3705 		she puts some in the bottom of the fish+bowl her fish are crazy about teeth too . 
_d3705 		she makes some into necklaces and some into bracelets she has more necklaces and bracelets than anyone . 
_d3705 		she just loves jewelry . 
_d3705 		of course every other fairy knows what kind of birthday presents she will get from the tooth+fairy . 
_d3705 		the pathway to her house is paved with teeth . 
_d3705 		and there are always stars outside her window at night . 
_d3705 		at least it looks that way because she has hung clothes+lines full of teeth in the sky just in case the real stars don't come out . 
_d3705 		well it's a pretty decoration I think . 
