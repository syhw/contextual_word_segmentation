_t4 		on this particular morning , animals from all over the Pride lands had journeyed to Pride rock in honor +//.
_t4 
_t4 		to , to honor the birth of their newborn cub Simba . 

_t4 		xxx but like that's not his name ,  I mean not to his face but like just us +/.
_t4 
_t4 		yes I can yes I can !
_t4 
_t4 		and I lifted the future king up high for all to see . 
_t4 		not far from the ceremony in a cave at the backside of Pride rock , a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled , life's [: life is] not fair , I shall never be king . 
_t4 		moments later Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave . 
_t4 		Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba , you should have been first in line . 
_t4 		I was first in line until the little hair+ball born , and with that Scar stalked out of the cave . 
_t4 		before long , Simba grew into a healthy , playful young cub . 
_t4 		early one morning , he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock . 
_t4 		as they looked out at the rising sun , Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands . 
_t4 		look Simba , everything the light touches is our kingdom . 
_t4 		what about that shadowy place , said Simba . 
_t4 		that's beyond our borders , you must never go there , Simba . 
_t4 		later as Simba headed back to the path , he ran into Scar . 
_t4 		hey uncle Scar , guess what , I'm going to be king of Pride rock , my dad showed me the whole kingdom . 
_t4 		he didn't show you what's beyond the rise at the northern borders , said Scar . 
_t4 		well no , he said I can't go there . 
_t4 		oh he's right , only the bravest lions go there , said Scar . 
_t4 		come on , said Simba , I just heard about this great place . 
_t4 		Simba pounced on Nala and Nala flipped Simba on his back . 
_t4 		they tumbled down the hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones . 
_t4 		we're way beyond the boundary of Pride ro(ck) +//.
_t4 
_t4 		of the Pride lands , said Nala . 
_t4 		and we're in danger . 
_t4 		suddenly , three hyenas slithered out of the eye sockets of an elephant skull . 
_t4 		a trio of trespassers , said the hyenas . 
_t4 		while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom , (.) Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with a swipe of his big paw . 
_t4 		I'm very disappointed in you Simba , you deliberately disobeyed me , he said . 
_t4 		I was just trying to be brave like you . 
_t4 		being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble , said Mufasa . 
_t4 		Dad , we're pals right , we'll always be together , won't we ? 
_t4 		Simba , said Mufasa , let me tell you something my father told me . 
_t4 		look at the stars , the great kings of the past look down on us from the stars . 
_t4 		so whenever you feel alone , just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you , and so will I . 
_t4 		meanwhile , Scar went to visit the hyenas . 
_t4 		I practically gift+wrapped those cubs for you and you couldn't even dispose of them . 
_t4 		Scar warned the hyenas to be prepared for the death of the king . 
_t4 		the following day , Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge . 
_t4 		when they arrived , Scar turned to his young nephew . 
_t4 		your father has a marvelous surprise for you , he said .
_t4 
_t4 		wildebeests . 
_t4 		didn't it +//?
_t4 
_t4 		didn't we read that they were going to get a wildebeest in the: (.) zoo , in our zoo ? 
_t4 		right ? 
_t4 		that's exciting . 
_t4 		Mufasa took off to save his young son . 
_t4 		but he plunged into the gorge and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests . 
_t4 		he found Simba , grabbed him by the nape of his neck and pulled him to a nearby ledge . 
_t4 		suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede . 
_t4 		desperately he tried to cli(mb) +//.
_t4 
_t4 		climb another ledge from which Scar stood looking down on him . 
_t4 		help me Brother , he said . 
_t4 		but Scar let go of Mufasa and he fell down . 
_t4 		it was an accident , said Scar , I didn't mean for it to happen . 
_t4 		what am I going to do , said Simba . 
_t4 		run away Simba , said Scar , run away and never return . 
_t4 		Scar returned to Pride rock to take over the throne . 
_t4 		meanwhile , Simba plodded across the savannah without any food or water . 
_t4 		and it wasn't long before he fainted under the hot sun . 
_t4 		he's so cute , can't we keep him ? 

_t4 		Simba stayed in the jungle with Pumbaa and Timon a long long time and grew into a very big lion . 
_t4 		but eventually he got homesick . 
_t4 		and one night he looked up at the stars and recalled the words his father had told him long ago . 
_t4 		the great kings of the past look down on us from those stars , so whenever you feel alone , just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I . 
_t4 		Simba came to his rescue but after wrestling with the lioness who easily flipped him on his back , he realized she was his old friend Nala . 
_t4 		why didn't you come back to Pride rock , she asked , you are the king . 
_t4 		I'm not the king , Scar is . 
_t4 		Simba , he let the hyenas take over the Pride lands , there's no food or , and no water . 
_t4 		and if you don't do something soon , everyone will starve . 
_t4 		you're our only hope . 
_t4 		Simba went to the reflecting pool and when he looked in the water , he saw a lion . 
_t4 		the ghost of Mufasa magically appeared . 
_t4 		look inside yourself Simba , you are more than what you have become . 
_t4 		you must take your place in the circle of life . 
_t4 		encouraged by his father's words , Simba returned to Pride rock . 
_t4 		when he arrived , he found the land bare and dry . 
_t4 		the hyenas were in control and Scar was shouting at Simba's mother . 
_t4 		I'm the king , said Scar , if you were half the king Mufasa was , I'm ten times the king Mufasa was . 
_t4 		suddenly a flash of lightning revealed the edge of Pride rock and there stood Simba . 
_t4 		I'm a little surprised to see you alive , Simba . 
_t4 		give me one good reason I shouldn't rip you apart , Scar . 
_t4 		but Scar forced Simba to say in front of all the lions that he had caused his father's death . 
_t4 		oh Simba , you're in trouble again but this time daddy isn't here to save you and everyone knows why . 
_t4 		Simba , knowing the truth , leapt on Scar . 
_t4 		Scar tried to escape . 
_t4 		and Simba ran after him , Scar pleaded with his nephew . 
_t4 		run away Scar , said Simba , and never return . 
_t4 		limping badly , Scar +//.
_t4 
_t4 		limping badly , Simba climbed to the top of pride rock and let out a magnificent roar as he looked out over his kingdom . 

_t4 		you can plant them in a garden or in pots . 

_t4 		neat huh ? 
_t4 		mhm .
_t4 
_t4 		preparing for winter . 
_t4 		in the fall wherever you live you may find signs of birds and animals getting ready for the winter . 
_t4 		many of them stock up on food before it becomes scarce and others are preparing shelters or homes to keep them warm and safe for the winter . 
_t4 		squirrels bury nuts in the fall . 
_t4 		any nuts that a squirrel forgets about may sprout and grow into trees +/.

_t4 
_t4 		but the stars look pretty here . 

_t4 		the days are shorter and the nights are longer . 
_t4 		in countries where the temperature drops below freezing point for much of the winter there is a lot of frost and snow . 
_t4 		and some places there may be snow on the ground for several months . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		this is neat this says how to make a snow shaker . 
_t4 		yeah that's [: that is] very neat .
_t4

_t4 
_t4 		stormy skies . 
_t4 		water colors are very good for painting moody skies and clouds . 
_t4 		especially if you wet the paper first . 
_t4 		before you start a picture try some of the ideas shown below to find out how to create different effects . 
_t4 		wow . 
_t4 		look at this you can make clouds . 

_t4 		that's [: that is] kinda [: kind of] like what falls from our tree .
_t4 
_t4 		this one ?
_t4 
_t4 		that's [: that is] kinda [: kind of] brown and then these are green right ?
_t4 
_t4 		winter trees . 
_t4 		trees that lose their leaves in winter are called deciduous trees . 
_t4 		well you learn something every day huh ? 
_t4 		almost all of them have broad flat leaves . 
_t4 		deciduous trees lose their leaves each fall and grow new ones in the following spring . 
_t4 		do all the leaves fall to the ground and we rake them up into big piles ? 
_t4 		or Manny rakes them up for us (be)cause he's [: he is] better at it than we are . 
_t4 		winter flowers  look at all +//. 
_t4 		few plants flower in the winter because frost and ice harm them but toward the end of the winter when it starts to get warmer the first flowers appeal .
_t4 
_t4 		look for them in sheltered spots in gardens parks and woodlands . 
_t4 		the crocus sometimes we see little crocus flowers here . 
_t4 		when winter is over . 

_t4 		that's [: that is] right . 
_t4 		bird watching . 
_t4 		it is hard for birds to find enough to eat in the winter so you can help them by putting out food and water for them in your yard or on a window ledge . 
_t4 		this gives a good opportunity to watch them at close hand . 
_t4 		know what we should pro(bab)ly do Honey ? 
_t4 		I think on our tree back there we have a bird feeder but it doesn't have any bird food in it do you think maybe this weekend we should buy some ? 

_t4 		maybe we could see a blue jay .
