_d7281 		but Henry barely moved along them . 
_d7281 		the truth was , Henry didn't want to reach the top of the mountain . 
_d7281 		because then he'd have_to cross the big , big bridge . 
_d7281 		if Percy and James and Henry are all afraid , thought Thomas , maybe I should be frightened too . 

_d7281 		Gordon was nowhere to be seen . 
_d7281 		he had already crossed the big bridge and rolled into the mountains beyond . 
_d7281 		Thomas and Henry were alone . 
_d7281 		I'll go first , Thomas said at last . 

_d7281 		go find Harold , Gordon  cried to Henry . 
_d7281 		relieved , Henry backed down the mountain to find the helicopter . 
_d7281 		Thomas kept his eyes closed , he was too afraid to look . 
_d7281 		but inside his coaches , the passengers enjoyed the wonderful view . 
