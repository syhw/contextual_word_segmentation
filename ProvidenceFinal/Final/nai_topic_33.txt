_t4 
_t4 		now there's room on the table to build a chicken coop . 
_t4 		see , I moved everything off . 
_t4 		are we gonna use some blocks for that ? 
_t4 		okay , it needs to be (.) safe . 
_t4 		what e(lse) +//?
_t4 
_t4 		how else should we build it ?
_t4 
_t4 		should it be square or round do you think ? 
_t4 		mmmm+(o)kay . 
_t4 		well , we'll need to have a doorway , won't we ? 
_t4 		oh , you're gonna make an open door for it ? 
_t4 		it's gonna be hard for the animals to get in there , don't you think ? 
_t4 		well +... 
_t4 		xxx they need a big door .
_t4 
_t4 		the chickens need a big door , don't they ? 
_t4 		oh , that's a nice big door actually .
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm+(o)kay . 
_t4 		ooh I think the fox is still hiding .
_t4 
_t4 		oh the fox is right there .
_t4 
_t4 		let's [: let us] make the fox hide until we finish making the chicken  . 
_t4 		foxes don't like to just sta:y around people . 
_t4 		you could put the well over here . 
_t4 		xxx doesn't matter . 
_t4 		you can have it wherever you want it . 
_t4 		what's the horse doing up there ? 
_t4 		mmmm , what a nice chicken coop there ! 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		to not be with strangers ? 
_t4 		mmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		there's another chick over here . 

_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm , they're safe in that coop ? 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		I think the fox is down there next to that toy basket .
_t4 
_t4 		right down here , on the floor . 
_t4 		see , hiding there ? 
_t4 		it's hiding pretty well if you can't see him (.) or her . 

_t4 
_t4 		I forgot .
_t4 
_t4 		is that what it wants to say ?
_t4 
_t4 		now do you think that fox can get into that chicken coop ? 
_t4 		you know , a fox who finds a chicken coop +//. 
_t4 		the fox can probably smell the chickens through the walls of the chicken coop .
_t4 
_t4 		and I bet that fox would prowl around and go around the chicken coop walking around looking for ways to get in . 
_t4 		don't you think it can just jump in over those walls ? 
_t4 		maybe the chicken coop should have (.) a roof . 
_t4 		xxx ,  dear (.) ,  dear , our chicken coop isn't (.) doesn't have a roof ! 
_t4 		chickens , chickens , o:h . 
_t4 		sometimes what a fox will do is carry an egg or maybe even a chick or a chicken off .
_t4 
_t4 		it won't actually stay to eat it there , I don't think .
_t4 
_t4 		because it wants to run away and make sure the people don't catch it , so it will carry away a chick or an egg . 
_t4 		yeah , let's [: let us] have a den for the fox .
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm , I was thinking (.) we could make +//. 
_t4 		lets +//.

_t4 		oh , all+right .
_t4 
_t4 		well , let's [: let us] see . 

_t4 		that one up there . 
_t4 		I'll get it , I'll get it , I'll get it .
_t4 
_t4 		we can put the baby in the bed instead .
_t4 
_t4 		o:h . 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		that might be a good fox den (.) if it's hidden . 
_t4 		camouflaged in the woods , let's make the forest down here .
_t4 
_t4 		there's the forest (.) with the trees . 
_t4 		and then a fox den could be under there . 
_t4 		mmmm foxes stay in a den (.) during the day and they come out at night . 
_t4 		xxx they don't want people to see them . 
_t4 		or other animals .
_t4 
_t4 		they're nocturnal .
_t4 
_t4 		foxes +//. 
_t4 		well actually , are they nocturnal ?
_t4 
_t4 		I think they're mostly nocturnal .
_t4 
_t4 		that means they do  +//. 
_t4 		their daytime is nighttime .
_t4 
_t4 		their daytime is our nighttime . 
_t4 		I wonder if foxes eat fish . 
_t4 		there're [: there are] some fish here too .

_t4 
_t4 		but the fox might like to go fishing and eat that fish . 
_t4 		I think we should look up if the fox +/.

_t4 		cause [: because] it wasn't in my bra this time . 
_t4 		it's just out here in the cold air . 
_t4 		there's another fish over there , too .

_t4 		xxx  .
_t4 
_t4 		so what's the fox gonna do n(ow) +//. 
_t4 		I think we need to build a roof for that coop because the fox got into that chicken coop .
_t4 
_t4 		we don't want the fox to get in there .
_t4 
_t4 		well +...
_t4 
_t4 		cause [: because] the farmers don't want that , do they ?
_t4 
_t4 		farmers want their (.) hens and chicks to be safe . 
_t4 		why ? 
_t4 		so that they can have (.) more eggs .
_t4 
_t4 		oh . 
_t4 		oh did you bump your hand ?

_t4 		o:h , good .
_t4 
_t4 		oh that looks pretty safe . 
_t4 		I don't know if the fox could get in there .

_t4 		foxes sometimes can take down fences and things , but not whole walls . 
_t4 		I think I see one over here . 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		where is the fox ? 
_t4 		in the den ? 
_t4 		is it nighttime ?
_t4 
_t4 		you mean it's daytime ? 
_t4 		it's sleeping during the day in its den , I think . 
_t4 		and then at night it will come out . 
_t4 		and look for chicks and chickens . 
_t4 		so what do the farmers need to do during the day ? 
_t4 		they're gonna check the chicken coop and make sure it's safe .
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm , I'm making my chicks and chickens safe .
_t4

_t4 
_t4 		oh , okay .
_t4 
_t4 		o:kay . 
_t4 		well that's a good place for them at night , but during the day , when there's , when there's sunlight and farmers are around and the dogs and cats and everyone's [: everyone is] around , it's safe to have the chickens come out and peck in the ground and run around . 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		oh , Pushpa should ?

_t4 
_t4 		there's the one about the farm that  gave you as a Christmas present in the box . 
_t4 		that's a new one . 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		should we dump all the pieces out ? 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		look at the picture , it might help us realize +//. 
_t4 		the water actually starts here .
_t4 
_t4 		there's water from (.) all the way from the bottom .
_t4 
_t4 		should we separate all the pieces and mix them all up ?
_t4 
_t4 		to make it harder ? 
_t4 		sometimes it's fun to make things harder .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		here's a corner . 
_t4 		I think that corner goes here .
_t4 
_t4 		why don't we start out with +//. 
_t4 		oh no , I'm sorry .
_t4 
_t4 		cause [: because] this is how it goes , and that I think is that corner . 
_t4 		did you know this is called an edge ?
_t4 
_t4 		this is the +/.
_t4 
_t4 		this is the right edge of the puzzle , and this is the left edge of the puzzle .
_t4 
_t4 		and this is the top edge of the puzzle , and this is the bottom edge of the puzzle . 
_t4 		well , where do you think sky might go ? 
_t4 		which edge do you think the sky might go (.) at ? 
_t4 		the top edge , right ?
_t4 
_t4 		this is the top edge . 
_t4 		I would guess sky would go at the top edge of the puzzle . 
_t4 		no it , no it might go somewhere here .
_t4 
_t4 		you might need to have something else he:re .
_t4 
_t4 		should we find all the sky pieces ? 
_t4 		and then try to f(ind) +/.
_t4 
_t4 		yup [: yes] .
_t4 
_t4 		well (.) the  +//.
_t4 
_t4 		which is the straight part of that piece ?
_t4 
_t4 		this part is straight . 
_t4 		so put the straight part against the straight part of the puzzle base . 
_t4 		right ?
_t4 
_t4 		okay , let's [: let us] see where that one goes . 
_t4 		does it go there ? 
_t4 		he:y , it does ! 
_t4 		here's some more sky .
_t4 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		I think those are all sky pieces .
_t4 
_t4 		is that a cor(ner) +//?
_t4 
_t4 		o:h , you're right .
_t4 
_t4 		that looks like a sky: corner piece . 
_t4 		I don't know . 
_t4 		try that maybe ?
_t4 
_t4 		yeah ?
_t4 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		somewhere up here , I think along the top edge . 
_t4 		does it fit ? 
_t4 		does it +...
_t4 
_t4 		does it have a little brown piece ?
_t4 
_t4 		how many pieces are along the top edge ?
_t4 
_t4 		eight !
_t4 
_t4 		eight .
_t4 
_t4 		this is number eight .
_t4 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . 
_t4 		that means there will be eight pieces along the bottom edge also . 
_t4 		cause [: because] they will have the same number of pieces . 
_t4 		this also looks like sky . 
_t4 		he:y !
_t4 
_t4 		is it +//? 
_t4 		does it have a straight edge , that piece ?
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		I see some more +...
_t4 
_t4 		let's [: let us] see , those two pieces have some sky . 
_t4 		this piece has some sky .
_t4 
_t4 		let's [: let us] get all the pieces with some sky .
_t4 
_t4 		this has a +//.
_t4 
_t4 		did you say (v)oila ?
_t4 
_t4 		voila ,  .
_t4 
_t6 		did Daddy teach you that word ? 
_t6 		voila: .
_t6 
_t6 		xxx .
_t6 
_t6 		is that something you say when you do puzzles ? 
_t6 		xxx .
_t6 
_t6 		it almost goes , but it needs to have a straight (.) edge . 
_t6 		this is the left edge of the puzzle .
_t6 
_t6 		so you need to have a piece that has +/.
_t6 
_t6 		a straight edge .
_t6 
_t6 		what about that one ?
_t6 
_t6 		wanna try that one ?
_t6 
_t6 		wanna try that one ? 
_t6 		mmmm . 
_t6 		well that wouldn't need to have a straight +//. 
_t6 		whatever goes here would need to have a straight edge .
_t6 
_t6 		and there's no more sky . 
_t6 		we should get some more edge pieces . 
_t6 		hmmm , there's a lot of edge piece(s) +/.
_t6 
_t6 		it's an edge +//.
_t6 
_t6 		it needs to be an edge piece that has some of this color water .
_t6 
_t6 		with a straight edge +/.
_t6 
_t6 		mmmm , that's a good guess . 
_t6 		let's [: let us] see , straight edges but with water . 
_t6 		this piece has a straight edge and some water . 
_t6 		wanna check that one out ? 
_t6 		voila: !
_t6 
_t6 		and the next piece below that would be one that has a straight edge and some fe:rns .
_t6 
_t6 		one straight edge +//. 
_t6 		this has one straight edge and some ferns .
_t6 
_t6 		do you wanna check and see if that goes there ? 
_t6 		xxx . 
_t6 		and then the next piece would have one straight edge and some tree trunk . 
_t6 		and maybe part of the neck , tree trunk and neck . 
_t6 		are there any pieces with straight edges that have some tree trunk and some neck ? 
_t6 		I'm finding all the pieces with straight edges . 
_t6 		this is +... 
_t6 		this has got tree trunk .
_t6 
_t6 		straight edge and it has tree trunk . 
_t6 		does that go I wonder ? 
_t6 		match up the straight edge of the piece with the straight edge of the puzzle . 
_t6 		that means turn it around so that the straight edge is there . 
_t6 		he:y .
_t6 
_t6 		oh you're right . 
_t6 		that piece needs to be a corner .
_t6 
_t6 		mmmm there must be corner pieces somewhere . 
_t6 		can you look carefully ?
_t6 
_t6 		a corner piece is a piece that has two straight edges , right ?
_t6 
_t6 		that has two straight edges , there and there .
_t6 
_t6 		mmmm+hmmm , here , you're sitting on some .
_t6 
_t6 		yeah .
_t6 
_t6 		okay .
_t6 
_t4 		so we need a corner piece that has some tree+trunk . 
_t4 		I'm looking for another corner piece . 
_t4 		oh , here's a corner piece . 
_t4 		wanna try that one ?
_t4 
_t4 		no:w , I have a question for you . 
_t4 		how many corner pieces does this puzzle have ?
_t4 
_t4 		when it's all done , how many corner pieces would there be ? 
_t4 		right , when it's all done there should be four corner pieces cause [: because] there are four corners in this rectangular puzzle . 
_t4 		and how many do we have so far ?
_t4 
_t4 		one , two , three .
_t4 
_t4 		we only need one more (.) corner piece . 
_t4 		so I see one and I think I'm gonna put it here cause [: because] I think it's gonna go there . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		which part of the puzzle should we try next ? 
_t4 		he:y ! 
_t4 		that fits !
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm , the next piece here needs to have +//. 
_t4 		what is that ?
_t4 
_t4 		is that part of an animal or part of the tree ?
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		hmmm , it needs to be a right edge piece cause [: because] this is a +//. 
_t4 		hey what about that piece ?
_t4 
_t4 		oh , maybe not .
_t4 
_t4 		maybe that goes down there . 
_t4 		that piece , does it go there ? 
_t4 		he:y . 
_t4 		okay , we nee:d to find that piece . 
_t4 		well , we've done quite a bit , haven't we ? 
_t4 		mmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		here's an +//.
_t4 
_t4 		here's what I think might be +//. 
_t4 		hey , good job !
_t4 
_t4 		this might be a right edge piece . 
_t4 		what do you think ?
_t4 
_t4 		I think this is part of an animal . 
_t4 		so we need a right edge piece +/.
_t4 
_t4 		here is (.) an edge piece that has the same color as that . 
_t4 		he:y !
_t4 
_t4 		o:h , yeah you're right . 
_t4 		the little tip of that dino snout .
_t4 
_t4 		and that wouldn't be an edge piece , would it ?
_t4 
_t4 		that would just be a regular piece .
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm look for a tiny piece of snout . 
_t4 		oh , is that a tiny piece of snout ? 
_t4 		hmmm , I think this one . 
_t4 		look , there's the tiny piece of snout .
_t4 
_t4 		is it ? 
_t4 		no: , maybe not . 
_t4 		it's just in front of that other dinosaur .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		I wonder if that +//.
_t4 
_t4 		does this go somewhere here ?
_t4 
_t4 		no . 
_t4 		no .
_t4 
_t4 		I don't know , maybe like there . 
_t4 		I think this brown dinosaur might be a really big one . 
_t4 		how (a)bout that ? 
_t4 		oh , I guess I'm wrong .
_t4 
_t4 		that doesn't go there . 
_t4 		mmmm , sometimes you just have_to try things out . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		what about this color here ?
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm , this is some sky in here . 
_t4 		sky . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		I'm looking for a head (.) piece . 
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		a little bit of a mouth . 
_t4 		xxx I wonder whose snout that is . 
_t4 		he:y !
_t4 
_t4 		great !
_t4 
_t4 		now we have the rest of that dino's body . 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		we found our mittens we have lost ? 
_t4 		I don't think that goes there , though . 
_t4 		it's not fitting .
_t4 
_t4 		are you sitting on any pieces , by the way ? 
_t4 		can you check ?
_t4 
_t4 		I see one under you there . 
_t4 		I don't think it goes there . 
_t4 		you're right , it's the same color , but (.) you need like the little tiny back of that +... 
_t4 		ah .
_t4 
_t4 		oh , so try that one over here now .
_t4 
_t4 		yep [: yes] , I think that's right . 
_t4 		hey he:y . 
_t4 		I don't know . 
_t4 		you need a piece with sky to go there . 
_t4 		I'm gonna try this one . 
_t4 		no , it doesn't go . 
_t4 		how (a)bout this piece of sky ?
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		a little bit , yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		I noticed that one was . 
_t4 		well because the kind of wood that these are made out of , it's called like  pressed wood . 
_t4 		it's called , it's called like laminate pressed wood . 
_t4 		and so (.) moisture can get inside the wood and change the shape of the piece a tiny tiny tiny bit . 
_t4 		does that go there ? 
_t4 		yes .
_t4 
_t4 		you find some red to match this (.) dinosaur's coloring there ? 
_t4 		that looks like it could be a spinosaurus , doesn't it ? 
_t4 		like the one that's in the other puzzle ? 
_t4 		actually , you know what , I think the back has a guide +... 
_t4 		it tells you what kind of +//.
_t4 
_t4 		I'm just gonna see if that's a spinosaurus , number six . 
_t4 		yes , that's a spinosaurus , actually .
_t4 
_t4 		and there's a brachiosaurus . 
_t4 		which one is that one ?
_t4 
_t4 		right at the top . 
_t4 		I think this is the brachiosaurus . 
_t4 		brachiosaurus has a really really long , curved neck .
_t4 
_t4 		and I think this maybe goes here .
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm , turn it around a little . 
_t4 		you're right .
_t4 
_t4 		try turning it all the way around . 
_t4 		does it go there ? 
_t4 		yes .
_t4 
_t4 		voila .
_t4 
_t4 		I see a bit of a grey dinosaur's neck there . 
_t4 		do you think that might go ?
_t4 
_t4 		mmmm , it's all affected by the humidity .
_t4 
_t4 		it's not very humid now , but it was humid this summer , so +...
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		gee , we're about halfway , almost +//.
_t4 
_t4 		I think we're more than halfway done .
_t4 
_t4 		I see something that might go there . 
_t4 		hmmm , looks like an edge , like a bottom edge piece , doesn't it ? 
_t4 		yeah try that , the bot(tom) , the straight edge +... 
_t4 		yup [: yes] stick that little (.) peg right there .
_t4 
_t4 		there . 
