_d5953 		you know what the easiest place to start I think would be ?
_d5953 
_d5953 		see how there's pink flowers only on the left side of the picture ? 
_d5953 		why don't we find all the pieces that have part of the pink flower in them ?

_d5953 		excuse me , your hair and head is right in the way . 
_d5953 		I can't see the puzzle at all .

_d5954 		and this bird should have more bird body .
_d5954 
_d5954 		does this go to this ? 
_d5954 		I think this part +... 

_d5955 		see ? 
_d5955 		all that piece has is beak . 
_d5955 		this is another part of a bird . 
_d5955 		do you think it goes here ? 
_d5955 		mmmm+hmmm .
_d5955 
_d5955 		I think we could find a corner piece that might +//. 
_d5955 		oh wait .
_d5955 
_d5955 		this is a corner piece that must go up here . 
_d5955 		the bird's body is (.) there .
_d5955 
_d5955 		mmmm+hmmm . 

_d5955 		xxx is it an edge piece or not ?
_d5955 
_d5955 		does it have one sm(ooth) , one flat side ? 
_d5955 		let's [: let us] look at the picture of the cover , on the cover , and see where a piece of bud belongs . 
_d5955 		I got that one up here .

_d5955 		mmmm+hmmm .
_d5955 
_d5955 		oh here's another edge , I mean corner piece .
_d5955 		I wonder if that's the corner piece for the bottom left . 
_d5955 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_d5955 		I think upside down and sideways . 
_d5955 		like that ? 
_d5955 		and I think (.) this corner piece might go +//. 
_d5955 		oh wait , maybe not .
_d5955 
_d5955 		I think maybe this is the corner piece for this side . 
_d5955 		I don't know if it goes there .
_d5955 
_d5955 		I think we need more fur .
_d5955 
_d5955 		we need a bottom piece with more fur . 
_d5955 		let's [: let us] see . 
_d5955 		like that . 
_d5955 		xxx bottom piece .
_d5955

_d5955 
_d5955 		how bout [: about] up in this part ?
_d5955 
_d5955 		maybe . 
_d5955 		we're still missing one more corner piece . 
_d5955 		let's [: let us] find the corner piece .
_d5955 
_d5955 		hmmm . 
_d5955 		I don't see it .
_d5955 
_d5956 		wait , this is a corner piece . 
_d5956 		this must go here .
_d5956 
_d5956 		probably missing one edge piece here .
_d5956 
_d5956 		xxx .
_d5956 
_d5956 		let's [: let us] see . 
_d5956 		hmmm , there's a side piece . 
_d5956 		that goes there .
_d5956 
_d5956 		well , it's [: it has] gotta go right on the edge , doesn't it ? 
_d5956 		along that edge I think . 
_d5957 		wait a minute . 
_d5957 		I think that's a black ear . 
_d5957 		I think that goes up here .
_d5957 
_d5957 		aha . 
_d5957 		see look , there's the black ear ?

_d5957 
_d5957 		or part of this ear ? 
_d5957 		check here .

_d5957 		does it fit in to that ? 
_d5957 		hmmm . 
_d5957 		no .
_d5957 
_d5957 		does this go here ? 
_d5957 		it does . 
_d5957 		and that goes there .
_d5957 
_d5957 		the whole top edge is done now .
_d5957 
_d5957 		Naima , how about if that +//?
_d5957 
_d5957 		yeah , is it right ? 
_d5957 		no .
_d5957 
_d5957 		it's too loose to fit . 
_d5957 		how bout [: about] +..?
_d5957 
_d5957 		I don't think we have a place to put that one yet . 
_d5957 		it looks like an ear . 
_d5957 		maybe it's the other +//.
_d5957 
_d5957 		maybe it goes +...
_d5957 
_d5957 		look and see how the brown branch connects to the black ear ?
_d5957 
_d5957 		that's this right here . 
_d5957 		o:h . 
_d5957 		it does go there . 
_d5957 		yes . 

_d5958 		there have_to be at least a few . 
_d5958 		this is an edge piece , this is an edge piece , this is an edge piece .
_d5958 
_d5958 		o:h , a very small amount of pink , uh+huh .
_d5958 
_d5958 		mmmm . 
_d5958 		that doesn't go . 
_d5958 		sometimes you just have_to try a+lot of pieces and see what , what fits . 
_d5958 		does that go ? 
_d5958 		yeah , I guess it does go . 
_d5958 		that's nice , isn't it ? 
_d5958 		oh , we still need some edge pieces to be found . 
_d5958 		this is another edge piece . 
_d5958 		where it goes , I don't know .
_d5958 
_d5958 		mmmm . 
_d5958 		how bout [: about] there ? 

_d5958 		ya:y !
_d5958 
_d5958 		it's starting to look more like the picture , isn't it ? 
_d5958 		that doesn't go there .

_d5958 
_d5958 		do you s(ee) +/.
_d5958 
_d5958 		but that didn't look like an edge piece .
_d5958 
_d5958 		this is an edge piece .
_d5958 
_d5959 		oh ,  , an ear ? 
_d5959 		how about on there ? 
_d5959 		will it attach to that ear ?
_d5959 
_d5959 		I think s(o) +//. 
_d5959 		no ?
_d5959 
_d5959 		are you sure ?

_d5959 		you were right , it doesn't go there . 
_d5959 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_d5959 		certainly , the first time you do a puzzle is the hardest I think . 
_d5959 		do you think so ? 
_d5959 		Daddy will be very surprised . 
_d5959 		that doesn't go there . 
_d5959 		hmmm . 
_d5959 		that goes .
_d5959 
_d5959 		all that bluish . 
_d5959 		I still don't understand what piece goes there , though .
_d5959 
_d5959 		cause there's a+lot of fur involved . 
_d5960 		xxx , that doesn't really go . 
_d5960 		hmmm . 
_d5960 		I think we're missing an edge piece that has black in it . 
_d5960 		those don't have any edges . 
_d5960 		well I hope we weren't missing a piece when it was a new puzzle . 
_d5960 		let's [: let us] lift up and look and see if we +... 
_d5960 		somehow did we miss some ? 
_d5960 		look behind you , where the other box is . 
_d5960 		are there any pieces under that ? 
_d5960 		guess not . 
_d5960 		okay , maybe we're just missing a piece . 
