_t4 		the prehistoric animals included in this book are just a few of the strange and interesting creatures that once roamed our planet .
_t4 
_t4 		huh what's that ? 
_t4 		a wooly+mammoth . 
_t4 		wow . 
_t4 		sure . 
_t4 		wooly+mammoths were a type of prehistoric elephant the wooly+mammoth which was distinguished by its long shaggy hair was almost thirteen feet tall . 
_t4 		and appeared about two million years ago during the ice+age (.) of the pleistocene epoch . 
_t4 		right ? 
_t4 		looks similar . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		because it had a thick layer of fat under its skin as well as abundant hair the wooly+mammoth managed to keep warm in the year+round winter  . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		crash . 
_t4 		yeah I think so . 
_t4 		the mammoth lost relatively little body heat through it's ears +/. 
_t4 		boom . 
_t4 		it's ears were very small . 
_t4 		it's long curved tusks enabled it to find food by clearing away snow and ice . 
_t4 		wooly+mammoths have been found preserved in the frozen tundra of Siberia . 
_t4 		prehistoric man who probably hunted them for food decorated caves with drawings of these magnificent animals . 
_t4 		wow .
_t4 
_t4 		very long . 
_t4 		huh who's this ? 
_t4 		the saber+tooth tigers first appeared sometime between twenty six and thirty six million years ago . 
_t4 		oh my gosh his tusks are going in his mouth . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		wow . 
_t4 		there we go . 
_t4 		does that sound better ? 
_t4 		this group included many different kinds of cats all of which had long fangs in their upper jaws . 
_t4 		these cats were carnivores or meat eaters and use their sharp  sharp teeth to pierce the thick skins of the plant eating animals . 
_t4 		exact . 
_t4 		yeah smiladon sounds like mastadon . 
_t4 		they're both Latin names . 
_t4 		hello smarty+pants . 

_t4 		what a long nose he has .
_t4 
_t4 		achoo . 
_t4 		the machrauchenia was about eleven feet tall and was shaped like a camel but with no humps . 
_t4 		fossils show that its nose openings were high up on the skull suggesting that it had some sort of trunk . 
_t4 		it woulduv [: would have] used its trunk as an elephant does today to obtain food and water . 
_t4 		since eac of its toes were hoofed machrauchenia would've [: would have] been able to run quickly to escape predators . 
_t4 		huh what's this ? 
_t4 		it looks more like what ?
_t4 
_t4 		what animal does the brontatherium look like ? 

_t4 		yeah I think so . 
_t4 		brontatherium was a plant eater that grew up to eight feet tall . 

_t4 		hello I'm a giant sloth . 
_t4 		wow that is one big sloth huh ? 
_t4 		yeah let's see what it says about the sloth here . 
_t4 		it says the giant sloth was tru:ly hu:ge about twenty feet long from nose to tail . 
_t4 		I'm huge . 
_t4 		let's see this one says we're strange creatures . 
_t4 		the wooly+mammoth says I have long tusks and wooly hair . 
_t4 		um this one says +/. 
_t4 		that one says the wooly hair has the wooly+mammoth has long shaggy hair and is just thirteen feet tall . 
_t4 		this one says the saber+tooth tiger has long pointy fangs . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		this one says the machrauchenia has a long trunk+like nose . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		the brontatherium says that the brontatherium ate leaves and fruit from the trees . 
_t4 		the thorahockis says that the birds could not fly they ran on their feet . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_t4 
_t4 		the machrauchenia says I have a long nose . 
_t4 		it says that the machrauchenia was eleven feet tall and looked like a camel with no humps . 
_t4 		the brontatherium says that they had horns and they used to fight each other with their horns . 
_t4 		this one says that there were lots_of unusual creatures (.) that roamed the earth many many years ago . 
_t4 		it says the wolly+mammoth had pretty small ears . 
_t4 		that says that the wooly+mammoth lived during the ice+age . 
_t4 		it says that one of the saber+tooth tigers was called a smiladon . 
_t4 		it had long knife like teeth which were over six inches long . 

_t4 		wow . 
_t4 		achoo . 
_t4 		achoo . 
_t4 		the brontatherium says they had a y shaped forked horn on the top of their snout . 
_t4 		the thorahockis says it was about five feet tall and had a long neck and small wings . 
_t4 		because the wings were so small they could not use them to fly instead the wings may have helped the bird to maintain balance while it ran on its powerful legs . 
_t4 		yummy . 
_t4 		huh the giant sloth had long curved claws and fed by stripping leaves with its tongue . 
_t4 		but when the giant sloth was on the ground its claws forced the animal to walk on the sides of its feet making movement difficult . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		although its slow progress made the giant sloth an easy target for meat eaters its claws served as effective weapons .
_t4 
_t4 		interesting . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 

_t4 
_t4 		please . 
_t4 		which one ? 
_t4 		ah let's see . 
_t4 		this one is that's what friends are for do you want that one ? 
_t4 		that one is   ouch . 
_t4 		there's so many books in there it's hard to get out . 
_t4 		let me see . 
_t4 		really ? 
_t4 		you want the tooth+fairy book ? 
_t4 		look what I found over here though . 
_t4 		the tooth+fairy . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_t4 
_t4 		okay I can't you know what I can't get that one out because it's too far back . 
_t4 		I think that's the everything book . 
_t4 		okay well why don't we read the tooth+fairy first and then I'll have_to work on digging that other one out . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		you're right . 
_t4 		thi is the tooth+fairy . 
_t4 		she has lots_of teeth . 
_t4 		she has lots_of dimes and quarters too . 
_t4 		she needs them because when you are asleep she comes and takes away the tooth that you have put under your pillow . 
_t4 		and she puts the money there instead . 
_t4 		sometimes she forgets and then of course your tooth is still there in the morning instead of the money . 
_t4 		that this is because she works so hard . 
_t4 		the tooth+fairy has to work harder than the Easter bunny because the Easter bunny only works on Easter . 
_t4 		the tooth+fairy works harder than Santa Claus because there's only one night when Santa goes down all those chimneys but the tooth+fairy is busy every night . 
_t4 		that's Santa with a big sack of toys . 
_t4 		if she forgets to take your tooth one night she usually remembers it the next . 
_t4 		she will take your tooth home with her along with all the others she has collected that night . 
_t4 		when she gets home the first thing she does with your teeth is to sort them . 
_t4 		lower teeth extra teeth bottom teeth teeny teeth very clean teeth . 
_t4 		girl's teeth boy's teeth shiny teeth first teeth small teeth . 
_t4 		she puts some of the pretty ones in a glass jar on a high shelf in the kitchen she thinks they look nice there . 
_t4 		they do look nice there don't they ? 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		pretty . 
_t4 		she puts some in the bottom of the fish+bowl her fish are crazy about teeth too . 
_t4 		she makes some into necklaces and some into bracelets she has more necklaces and bracelets than anyone . 
_t4 		she just loves jewelry . 
_t4 		of course every other fairy knows what kind of birthday presents she will get from the tooth+fairy . 
_t4 		the pathway to her house is paved with teeth . 
_t4 		and there are always stars outside her window at night . 
_t4 		at least it looks that way because she has hung clothes+lines full of teeth in the sky just in case the real stars don't come out . 
_t4 		well it's a pretty decoration I think . 
_t4 		oh really ? 
_t4 		thank you . 
