_t4 
_t4 		huh what's that ? 
_t4 		a wooly+mammoth . 
_t4 		wow . 
_t4 		sure . 
_t4 		wooly+mammoths were a type of prehistoric elephant the wooly+mammoth which was distinguished by its long shaggy hair was almost thirteen feet tall . 
_t4 		and appeared about two million years ago during the ice+age (.) of the pleistocene epoch . 
_t0 		right ? 
_t0 		looks similar . 
_t0 		right . 
_t0 		because it had a thick layer of fat under its skin as well as abundant hair the wooly+mammoth managed to keep warm in the year+round winter  . 
_t0 		xxx . 
_t0 		crash . 
_t0 		yeah I think so . 
_t0 		the mammoth lost relatively little body heat through it's ears +/. 
_t0 		boom . 
_t0 		it's ears were very small . 
_t0 		it's long curved tusks enabled it to find food by clearing away snow and ice . 
_t0 		wooly+mammoths have been found preserved in the frozen tundra of Siberia . 
_t0 		prehistoric man who probably hunted them for food decorated caves with drawings of these magnificent animals . 
_t0 		wow .
_t0 
_t0 		very long . 
_t0 		huh who's this ? 
_t0 		the saber+tooth tigers first appeared sometime between twenty six and thirty six million years ago . 

_t0 		wow . 
_t0 		there we go . 
_t0 		does that sound better ? 
_t0 		this group included many different kinds of cats all of which had long fangs in their upper jaws . 
_t0 		these cats were carnivores or meat eaters and use their sharp  sharp teeth to pierce the thick skins of the plant eating animals . 
_t0 		exact . 
_t0 		yeah smiladon sounds like mastadon . 
_t0 		they're both Latin names . 
_t0 		hello smarty+pants . 

_t0 		what a long nose he has .
_t0 
_t0 		achoo . 
_t0 		the machrauchenia was about eleven feet tall and was shaped like a camel but with no humps . 
_t0 		fossils show that its nose openings were high up on the skull suggesting that it had some sort of trunk . 
_t0 		it woulduv [: would have] used its trunk as an elephant does today to obtain food and water . 
_t0 		since eac of its toes were hoofed machrauchenia would've [: would have] been able to run quickly to escape predators . 
_t0 		huh what's this ? 
_t0 		it looks more like what ?
_t0 
_t0 		what animal does the brontatherium look like ? 

_t0 		yeah I think so . 
_t0 		brontatherium was a plant eater that grew up to eight feet tall . 

_t4 		yeah let's see what it says about the sloth here . 
_t4 		it says the giant sloth was tru:ly hu:ge about twenty feet long from nose to tail . 
_t4 		I'm huge . 
_t4 		let's see this one says we're strange creatures . 
_t4 		the wooly+mammoth says I have long tusks and wooly hair . 
_t4 		um this one says +/. 
_t4 		that one says the wooly hair has the wooly+mammoth has long shaggy hair and is just thirteen feet tall . 
_t4 		this one says the saber+tooth tiger has long pointy fangs . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		this one says the machrauchenia has a long trunk+like nose . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		the brontatherium says that the brontatherium ate leaves and fruit from the trees . 
_t4 		the thorahockis says that the birds could not fly they ran on their feet . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_t4 
_t4 		the machrauchenia says I have a long nose . 
_t4 		it says that the machrauchenia was eleven feet tall and looked like a camel with no humps . 
_t4 		the brontatherium says that they had horns and they used to fight each other with their horns . 
_t4 		this one says that there were lots_of unusual creatures (.) that roamed the earth many many years ago . 
_t4 		it says the wolly+mammoth had pretty small ears . 
_t4 		that says that the wooly+mammoth lived during the ice+age . 
_t4 		it says that one of the saber+tooth tigers was called a smiladon . 

_t4 		achoo . 
_t4 		achoo . 
_t4 		the brontatherium says they had a y shaped forked horn on the top of their snout . 
_t4 		the thorahockis says it was about five feet tall and had a long neck and small wings . 
_t4 		because the wings were so small they could not use them to fly instead the wings may have helped the bird to maintain balance while it ran on its powerful legs . 
_t4 		yummy . 
_t4 		huh the giant sloth had long curved claws and fed by stripping leaves with its tongue . 
_t4 		but when the giant sloth was on the ground its claws forced the animal to walk on the sides of its feet making movement difficult . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		although its slow progress made the giant sloth an easy target for meat eaters its claws served as effective weapons .
_t4 
_t4 		interesting . 

_t4 
_t4 		please . 
_t4 		which one ? 
_t4 		ah let's see . 
_t4 		this one is that's what friends are for do you want that one ? 
_t4 		that one is   ouch . 
_t4 		there's so many books in there it's hard to get out . 
_t4 		let me see . 
_t4 		really ? 
_t4 		you want the tooth+fairy book ? 
_t4 		look what I found over here though . 
_t4 		the tooth+fairy . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_t4 
_t4 		okay I can't you know what I can't get that one out because it's too far back . 
_t4 		I think that's the everything book . 
_t4 		okay well why don't we read the tooth+fairy first and then I'll have_to work on digging that other one out . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		you're right . 
_t4 		thi is the tooth+fairy . 
_t4 		she has lots_of teeth . 
_t4 		she has lots_of dimes and quarters too . 
_t4 		she needs them because when you are asleep she comes and takes away the tooth that you have put under your pillow . 
_t4 		and she puts the money there instead . 
_t4 		sometimes she forgets and then of course your tooth is still there in the morning instead of the money . 
_t4 		that this is because she works so hard . 
_t4 		the tooth+fairy has to work harder than the Easter bunny because the Easter bunny only works on Easter . 
_t4 		the tooth+fairy works harder than Santa Claus because there's only one night when Santa goes down all those chimneys but the tooth+fairy is busy every night . 
_t4 		that's Santa with a big sack of toys . 
_t4 		if she forgets to take your tooth one night she usually remembers it the next . 
_t4 		she will take your tooth home with her along with all the others she has collected that night . 
_t4 		when she gets home the first thing she does with your teeth is to sort them . 
_t4 		lower teeth extra teeth bottom teeth teeny teeth very clean teeth . 
_t4 		girl's teeth boy's teeth shiny teeth first teeth small teeth . 
_t4 		she puts some of the pretty ones in a glass jar on a high shelf in the kitchen she thinks they look nice there . 
_t4 		they do look nice there don't they ? 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		pretty . 
_t4 		she puts some in the bottom of the fish+bowl her fish are crazy about teeth too . 
_t4 		she makes some into necklaces and some into bracelets she has more necklaces and bracelets than anyone . 
_t4 		she just loves jewelry . 
_t4 		of course every other fairy knows what kind of birthday presents she will get from the tooth+fairy . 
_t4 		the pathway to her house is paved with teeth . 
_t4 		and there are always stars outside her window at night . 
_t4 		at least it looks that way because she has hung clothes+lines full of teeth in the sky just in case the real stars don't come out . 
_t4 		well it's a pretty decoration I think . 
_t4 		oh really ? 
_t4 		thank you . 

_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		alrighty . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		alright Snow White . 
_t4 		Snow White is so sweet and gentle she makes lots_of friends wherever she goes . 
_t4 		she is always cheerful and looks on the bright side . 
_t4 		she is romantic and longs to meet her true+love . 
_t4 		she is also very practical and works very hard . 
_t4 		that's important mmmm+hmmm ? 
_t4 		you ate all the pez . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ? 
_t4 		the purple pez you can have after lunch . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		yes .
_t4 
_t4 		oh you can't have lunch okay well then if you can't have lunch then you can't have pez . 
_t4 		okay should we read about Snow White ? 
_t4 		with hair as black as ebony and lips as red as roses and skin as white as snow this lovely princess is perfectly named Snow White . 
_t4 		not only is she beautiful but she is sweet natured too . 
_t4 		everyone loves her except of course her vain and jealous stepmother the queen . 
_t4 		her favorite things include singing and dancing which always cheer her up and give her courage when she's afraid . 
_t4 		telling stories is one of Snow White's great talents the seven dwarfs like to listen to her stories about the day her prince will come and how they'll live in a beautiful castle . 
_t4 		the animals and birds of the forest love Snow White's kind and gentle nature . 
_t4 		they even helped her clean up the dwarfs' messy cottage . 
_t4 		Snow White loves to walk in the enchanted forest and pick pretty flowers . 
_t4 		but she can't things into the too many flowers into the cottage because flowers make Sneezy sneeze . 
_t4 		when dwarfs when the dwarfs find out that Snow White is a good cook they are delighted even more so when they discover she can bake their favorite gooseberry pie . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		beyond the farthest hill stands the castle where she grew up with her wicked stepmother . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ? 
_t4 		right it's true . 
_t4 		Snow White has nowhere to go and gets lost in the dense forest . 
_t4 		eventually she can run no farther and she falls to the ground in tears  . 
_t4 		the seven hills really are jeweled because there are dazzling diamonds inside . 
_t4 		the seven dwarfs love to dig dig dig all day long in the diamond mines . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		oh+my+goodness . 
_t4 		so this is where Snow White grew up . 
_t4 		and this is where the dwarfs live . 
_t4 		and that's the prince's castle . 
_t4 		and (.) those are the diamond mines . 
_t4 		and the waterfalls . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ? 
_t4 		well this is when Snow White is  lost in the dark forest . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		right she got lost but the nice animals helped her out right ? 
_t4 		and they took her to the seven dwarfs' cottage . 
_t4 		right ? 
_t4 		one of the great gifts that Snow White has is the ability to make friends easily . 
_t4 		the animals and dwarfs would do anything for her even Grumpy . 
_t4 		but the queen is madly jealous of her naturally beautiful stepdaughter and the cruel queen is a very dangerous enemy to have . 
_t4 		as well as being Snow White's stepmother +... 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ? 
_t4 		right it says here as well as being Snow White's stepmother the queen is also a wicked witch . 
_t4 		she does not like Snow White and she uses a poison apple to try and get rid of her . 
_t4 		my+goodness . 
_t4 		that's not nice at all . 
_t4 		no no no . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_t4 
_t4 		right it's true there is the poison apple . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		no no .
_t4 
_t4 		the seven dwarfs and the birds and animals that meet Snow White love her dearly . 
_t4 		they try to protect her from the wicked queen and her spells . 
_t4 		although the huntsman is a loyal servant of the queen +... 
_t4 		he is always so sleepy isn't he .
_t4 
_t4 		there's Sneezy . 
_t4 		choo .
_t4 
_t4 		that's right he's always sneezing . 
_t4 		that's right . 
_t4 		here's the huntsman he's a loyal servant of the queen but he is not wicked . 
_t4 		seeing Snow White's sweet nature he cannot bear to carry out the queen's orders and hurt the princess . 
_t4 		well but he decides he cannot hurt Snow White . 
_t4 		he doesn't want to hurt her so he lets her go . 
_t4 		right ? 
_t4 		no it's not nice that he promised to do it in the first place right ? 
_t4 		you're so soft . 
_t4 		yes ? 
_t4 		that's the queen's castle . 
_t4 		where Snow White grew up . 
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		not so good . 
_t4 		nope nope nope nope . 
_t4 		from the moment that Snow White becomes more beautiful than the queen her life is in danger . 
_t4 		although the seven dwarfs tried their best they cannot protect her from the queen's black magic . 
_t4 		but good is stronger than evil . 
_t4 		and in the end the prince's love for Snow White saves the day . 
_t4 		well at first he thinks he's going to hurt Snow White . 
_t4 		but then he changes his mind he can't bring himself to harm her . 
_t4 		and he tells Snow White to run away from the queen . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_t4 
_t4 		right .
_t4 
_t4 		disguised as an old peddler woman the queen persuades trusting Snow White to take a bite of the poisoned apple . 
_t4 		she promises it will make her dream come true . 
_t4 		yes ? 
_t4 		right .
_t4 
_t4 		as soon as Snow White takes a bite of the apple she falls to the ground in a deep sleep and cannot be woken . 
_t4 		when the dwarves find her they place her in a special glass coffin . 
_t4 		yes . 
_t4 		she is very very mean you're right . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		but the dwarfs and Snow White +... 
_t4 		right . 
_t4 		but Snow White and the dwarfs and the prince are all very nice aren't they ? 

_t4 		well they are so jealous of Cinderella that they tear her outfit to pieces . 

_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ? 

_t4 		yesterday we went on a class trip to the museum of natural history . 
_t4 		we were very excited . 
_t4 		Gaspard and Lisa please try to stay out of trouble our teacher said as we got on the bus . 
_t4 		on the bus our teacher told us about some of the animal exhibits that we should see . 
_t4 		Lisa had been to the museum before and she said there was something even better dinosaurs so big one of their footprints could make a swimming pool for us . 
_t4 		the museum was very interesting our teacher showed us everything . 
_t4 		butterflies monkey tigers elephants and even the skeleton of a whale . 
_t4 		but the exhibit of extinct animals was the most exciting . 
_t4 		Gaspard and +/. 
_t4 		oh those are some extinct animals . 
_t4 		Gaspard and Lisa +/. 
_t4 		those are extinct animals which means they lived a very long time ago . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_t4 
_t4 		it looks like Gaspard and Lisa doesn't it ? 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		that's right . 
_t4 		Gaspard and Lisa our classmates joked you look like extinct animals . 
_t4 		the museum may want to keep you forever . 
_t4 		everyone laughed except for Lisa and me but it gave me an idea . 
_t4 		Lisa let's play a joke on our classmates I said and I told her my plan . 
_t4 		first we made two little signs and then we crept under the bars . 
_t4 		we put the signs in front of us and froze like statues . 
_t4 		I had forgotten to take off my scarf but our classmates didn't notice . 
_t4 		some of them even took pictures of us . 
_t4 		lots_of pictures . 
_t4 		our plan worked perfectly . 
_t4 		so perfectly that our class left without us . 
_t4 		the lights went out and the door closed  no . 
_t4 		we were locked in the museum . 
_t4 		what's to become of us Lisa cried ? 
_t4 		don't be afraid I answered we'll find something to eat we'll go to sleep and tomorrow we'll leave . 
_t4 		but the only thing to eat were dinosaur bones and in the dark they were sort of scary . 
_t4 		it was terrible being locked in the dark suddenly the dinosaurs started growling . 
_t4 		ah we shouted help . 
_t4 		but it wasn't the dinosaur it was the guard's dog who came to rescue us . 
_t4 		our teacher and classmates were happy to see us and boy were we happy to see them . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		let's put this one back . 
_t4 		hey . 
_t4 		yikes . 
_t4 		wow  really wow . 
_t4 		Nemo loved everything about school . 
_t4 		he loved swimming there everyday with his dad . 
_t4 		he loved his classmates he loved his teachers and he loved to learn . 
_t4 		and he really loved field trips . 
_t4 		even though on his very first trip he was fish+napped by a scuba+diving dentist and brought to an office aquarium in Sydney . 
_t4 		but that's another story . 
_t4 		every morning Nemo's dad Marlin would take him to school . 
_t4 		along the way Nemo always liked to ask his dad lots_of questions . 
_t4 		what's a whale's tongue like ? 
_t4 		how many clown+fish can a shark eat in one gulp ? 
_t4 		why are we called clown+fish asked Nemo ? 
_t4 		we're not funny at all . 
_t4 		Nemo saw his best friends Tadpole and Sheldon they loved to play tag and algae in the middle before school started . 
_t4 		Mr Ray was on school yard duty that morning he was everyone's favorite teacher . 
_t4 		Nemo and his friends had a special song they made up just for him . 
_t4 		he's our favorite teacher hip hip hooray . 
_t4 		before the big spotted manta we love Mr Ray . 
_t4 		then it was time for school to begin the first class of the day was music taught by +... 
_t4 		Senor Seaweed . 
_t4 		Nemo and his classmates were getting ready for the spring concert . 
_t4 		Nemo played the conch shell Sheldon played the clams Tad strummed along on some kelp and Pearl played sand+dollar tambourines . 
_t4 		Mr Ray taught science . 
_t4 		today's lesson was your ocean home . 
_t4 		Mr Ray called on Nemo where do you live Nemo ? 
_t4 		I mean +... 
_t4 		where does Nemo live ? 
_t4 		an anemone that's right . 
_t4 		while the rest of us would be hurt by its stings Nemo brushes himself against the anemone every day . 
_t4 		I guess Tad lives in the ocean . 
_t4 		hmmm really I think just clown+fish live in an anemone . 
_t4 		yup .
_t4 
_t4 		hmmm that's interesting . 
_t4 		then it was lunchtime . 

_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ? 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		that's right .
_t4 
_t4 		after lunch was recess yay . 
_t4 		everyone had fun playing hide and seek but then Sandy Plankton got in a bit of trouble . 
_t4 		it's like my dad always says says Nemo it's all fun and games until someone gets stuck in a giant clam . 
_t4 		oh no . 
_t4 		such a big big clam . 
_t4 		once Sandy was free it was time for Nemo's next class . 
_t4 		it turned out there was a guest teacher that day . 
_t4 		Dory . 
_t4 		hi Elmo she said waving to Nemo . 

_t4 		well (be)cause we don't wanna buy yet another pair of glasses I think daddy would be unhappy if mommy bought yet another pair . 
_t4 		I seem to go through glasses rather quickly . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		don't hurt me donkey . 
_t4 		oh thanks donkey . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		sweets you wanna read a book ? 
_t4 		book ? 
_t4 		should we read a book ? 
_t4 		wouldjou [: would you] like to pick one out ? 
_t4 		alright . 
_t4 		we could also play dominos too if you want . 
_t4 		wow . 
_t4 		you'd rather read Dot . 
_t4 		well okay . 
_t4 		hi there my name's Dot . 
_t4 		actually I'm princess Dot next in line to be queen of the whole ant hill . 
_t4 		of course my sister Ada's [: Ada is] actually queen now so I'll most likely be a princess for a long time . 
_t4 		don't get me wrong I like being a princess . 
_t4 		but to be honest with you I'd rather play around and be a member of my blueberry troop then perform royal duties . 
_t4 		and besides Ada's [: Ada is] a good queen even though she worries a lot . 
_t4 		she's a whole lot better than she used to be I'll tell you that much . 
_t4 		when she was a queen in training she used to get upset about everything . 
_t4 		of course there used to be a lot to get upset over . 
_t4 		you see our ant hill used to be in a ton of trouble . 
_t4 		there were these big mean old grasshoppers who would come to collect most of the grain we harvested every year . 
_t4 		we were all terrified of those grasshoppers . 
_t4 		they barely left us enough food for ourselves for the winter . 
_t4 		poor Ada . 
_t4 		I have_to admit she was stepping up to the throne at a bad time . 
_t4 		now my friend Flick he's a really cool guy . 
_t4 		he's an inventor and let me tell you he can invent anything . 
_t4 		once he made a telescope out of a drop of water that he put inside a rolled up leaf . 
_t4 		anyway during the last harvest we ever did for the grasshoppers Flick invented a harvesting machine . 
_t4 		it was really neat but no one except me would listen to him and see what amazing things his machine could do . 
_t4 		maybe if they had things would've been different . 
_t4 		one day we heard the grasshoppers arriving so we all ran inside the ant hill Flick was left outside with his invention . 
_t4 		I told you Flick was cool but I didn't tell you he could be kinda [: kind of] clumsy too . 
_t4 		he ended up knocking the entire offering of grain over the ledge and into the river below . 
_t4 		now we were in awfully big trouble . 
_t4 		the grasshoppers got really mad and even picked me up and threatened to squish me . 
_t4 		ah that's an ant's worst nightmare . 
_t4 		ah . 
_t4 		oh my gosh a nightmare . 
_t4 		don't squish me . 
_t4 		no yeah she's just a little princess ant .
_t4 
_t4 		don't squish her . 
_t4 		Flick felt so bad he came up with a plan to make things better . 
_t4 		what's donkey doing ? 
_t4 		is he eating your foot ?
_t4 
_t4 		really ? 
_t4 		really ? 
_t4 		oh it looked like he was nibbling on your toe . 
_t4 		you're right . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		now he has a necklace on . 
_t4 		wow . 
_t4 		oh it looks like a stethoscope . 
_t4 		well +... 
_t4 		okay . 
_t4 		he decided to leave our island to go in search of warrior bugs to protect us . 
_t4 		no ant had ever left ant island before . 
_t4 		good luck Flick I shouted as he flew away on a dandelion puff . 
_t4 		nobody believed he could do it nobody expect me that is . 
_t4 		you just watch I said . 
_t4 		he'll get the bestest roughest bugs you've ever seen . 
_t4 		and guess what ? 
_t4 		he did . 
_t4 		well sort of . 
_t4 		the only problem was that the warrior bugs Flick brought back were actually circus bugs . 
_t4 		it was a tiny mistake but it could still work out . 
_t4 		at least I thought it could . 
_t4 		Flick got the circus bugs and me and my whole blueberry troop to help him with his plan . 
_t4 		we made a giant fake bird out of leaves and twigs . 
_t4 		so when the grasshoppers return to get their food we would scare them by crawling inside the bird and flying it right at them . 
_t4 		it was a daring plan and Flick was great . 
_t4 		he was like the captain of our ship . 
_t4 		blueberries ready he asked when we were loaded inside the bird . 
_t4 		ready we shouted back . 
_t4 		then whoosh we were flying . 
_t4 		and we really scared those mean old grasshoppers . 
_t4 		they thought we were go they were going to get eaten by our bird . 
_t4 		but then we kinduv [: kind of] crashed . 
_t4 		none of us got hurt but the grasshoppers figured out what was going on . 
_t4 		and they realized we weren't a real bird after all . 
_t4 		but Flick was really brave he had stood up to the grasshoppers and gotten the whole colony to follow him . 
_t4 		and Ada helped him too together they fought off the biggest meanest grasshopper of them all . 
_t4 		in the end those mean old grasshoppers were scared away for good especially after a real live bird chased them down . 
_t4 		in the end the only sad part was that the circus bugs had to leave . 
_t4 		p+t Flea owner of the circus asked Flick to join them too . 
_t4 		sure you can't tour with us he asked ? 
_t4 		but Flick just said sorry my place is here . 
_t4 		anyway the circus bugs all promised to come back and visit us at our little ant hill . 
_t4 		and I sure hope they do . 
_t4 		in the meantime I think Ada has a crush on Flick . 
_t4 		I mean it's always been totally obvious that he had a crush on her but this is the first time I've seen her let him hold her hand and stuff . 
_t4 		I guess if I have_to have a brother in law Flick would be my first choice . 
_t4 		yes . 
_t4 		hmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		anyway I've gotta go now I wanna practice my flying before supper . 
_t4 		see ya [: you] later . 
