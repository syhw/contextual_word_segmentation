_d6548 		joey is still only a few months old , like all kangaroos he has strong back legs , large feet , and a long tail . 
_d6548 		when joey moves it's easy to see why his legs and body are so big and strong . 
_d6548 		he hops . 
_d6548 		joey bounces along on his back legs using his tail for balance . 
_d6548 		joey finds two other young kangaroos who are awake too . 
_d6548 		they start to wrestle each other poking tummies and tugging on ears and tails . 
_d6548 		little joey leads the others in a hopping race . 
_d6548 		a clucking noise makes him stop suddenly . 
_d6548 		it is his mother calling him .
_d6548 
_d6548 		she uses this sound to tell joey that he has wandered too far from her . 
_d6548 		joey tur(ns) returns to his mother , he is very tired now . 
_d6548 		the baby is the perfect , the pouch is the perfect size for her baby . 

_d6548 
_d6548 		an adult kangaroo stamps its foot on the ground , that sound means danger . 
_d6548 		joey's mother lifts her head and sniffs the air . 
_d6548 		suddenly a dingo dog comes running from the trees . 
_d6548 		the kangaroos must escape . 

_d6548 		the kangaroos are safe but they keep on moving . 
_d6548 		they are heading toward a patch of rain clouds . 

_d6548 		joey's little tummy is full now , joey leaves his mother's pouch . 

_d6548 		he licks his arm and rubs him all over his face . 
_d6548 		grooming kees joey clean and keeps the biting bugs away . 
_d6548 		when joey is finished grooming he looks for a playmate . 
_d6548 		joey hops to a pool filled with fresh rainwater . 
_d6548 		the pool is new to him .
_d6548 
_d6548 		the land where he lives is normally very dry . 
_d6548 		joey looks into the water , he sees another kangaroo looking back at him . 
_d6548 		who is it ? 

_d6583 		Harold circus . 
_d6583 		how (a)bout Harold circus ?
_d6583 
_d6583 		okay . 
_d6583 		and then we gotta find more stuff for the yard sale after this , okay ?
_d6583 
_d6583 		one  evening , mainly to prove to himself he could do it , Harold went for a walk on a tightrope . 
_d6583 		he made sure the rope was drawn tight and straight so it wouldn't sway .
_d6583 		he skipped lightly across and finding it fun to be a tightrope walker , high about the rest of the circus . 
_d6583 		he stayed upon the rope with the greatest of ease until he lost his balance . 
_d6583 		it also is easy to fall off a tightrope . 
_d6583 		Harold fell , twisting and turning with his purple crayon tight in his hands . 
_d6583 		by a stroke of luck a comfortable+looking curve appeared beneath him . 
_d6583 		quite a trick he thought , as he rewarded the elephant with a big peanut . 
_d6583 		elephants are such tall animals . 
_d6583 		Harold was still a long way from the ground .
_d6583 
_d6583 		so he swung down from the elephant's trunk to the neck of a smaller animal . 
_d6583 		it was a lovely circus horse , beautifully trained , and Harold easily put him into a brisk trot . 
_d6583 		Harold rode with no saddle in a splendid exhibition of circus+riding . 
_d6583 		at the finish of his bare+back act , he leapt gracefully from the horse . 
_d6583 		to his embarrassment , he fell and turned a rather ridiculous somersault . 
_d6583 		before anyone could laugh at the mishap , Harold pretended he had been clowning . 
_d6583 		he put a clown's smile on his face and he acted silly like a clown . 
_d6583 		finally he took off the hat and the smile . 
_d6583 		and he gave them back to the clown . 
_d6583 		the real clown was extremely funny . 
_d6583 		and Harold laughed and laughed at him . 
_d6583 		this , Harold told himself , probably was the best circus he had ever seen in his life . 
_d6583 		like all circuses , it had a fat lady . 
_d6583 		she was really amazingly fat . 
_d6583 		and of course there was a very tall man . 
_d6583 		he was really astoundingly tall . 
_d6583 		and next to him was a very small man . 
_d6583 		it was another man , the lemonade man . 
_d6583 		he had a great tank of lemonade . 
_d6583 		Harold stopped for a drink of it through a straw . 
_d6583 		it was quite refreshing .
_d6583 
_d6583 		he left some money on the counter to pay for the drink and he went on +... 
_d6583 		looking for the man who was shot out of a cannon . 
_d6583 		Harold wasn't what a man who was shot out of a cannon would look like . 
_d6583 		but anyway he wasn't there . 
_d6583 		though the cannon was nearly ready . 
_d6583 		the circus can't wait . 
_d6583 		there was only one thing to do , the cannon fitted Harold perfectly . 
_d6583 		he got into it and he shot out of it . 
_d6583 		he went up fast , he sailed to the top of the circus where the trapezes are . 
_d6583 		and the flying rings . 
_d6583 		he reached out , he caught on to a flying ring . 
_d6583 		he flung far out on it . 
_d6583 		he let go , doing a startling flip flop in the air and he dived straight down . 
_d6583 		he was sure the elephant would be there to catch him again . 
