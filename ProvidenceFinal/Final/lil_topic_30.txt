_t4 		remember what this one's called ? 
_t4 		what's it called ? 
_t4 		beauty .
_t4 
_t4 		and the beast . 
_t4 		long ago , an enchantress cast a spell on a castle and she transformed the handsome young prince into a hideous beast . 
_t4 		and his servants into household objects . 
_t4 		just look at me , grumbled the beast , I've been so cruel holding Belle captive in my castle , how will she ever see me as anything but a monster ? 
_t4 		come now , said Mrs Pots gently , all you have_to do is show her what's inside your heart , you must act like a gentleman , Lumiere said . 
_t4 		be romantic , compliment her , and most of all be kind , gentle and sincere . 
_t4 		and don't be so grumpy added Chip , Mrs Pots young son . 
_t4 		Mrs Pots gave her son a stern look , but they all knew Chip was right . 
_t4 		who's that ? 
_t4 		Lumiere . 
_t4 		I have an idea , said the beast smiling , why don't I invite Belle to go on a sleigh ride ? 
_t4 		it just snowed outside , and she might like the fresh air . 
_t4 		perfect said Lumiere , a wonderful idea agreed Mrs Pots . 
_t4 		very romantic +//. 
_t4 		bless you .
_t4 
_t4 		thank you .
_t4 
_t4 		added Chip , that's enough out of you Mrs Pots said to Chip , trying not to smirk . 
_t4 		the beast  Lumiere to extend his invitation . 
_t4 		that sounds lovely , said Belle , I've been stuck in this castle far too long . 
_t4 		she ran down the long staircase and stepped outside . 
_t4 		glimmering white snow flakes fell from the sky , it was a perfect white day ! 
_t4 		just then , the beast pulled up in a gleaming horse drawn sleigh . 
_t4 		how beautiful exclaimed Belle . 
_t4 		the beast smiled as he took her hand , and helped her into the sleigh . 
_t4 		he didn't mention he had slept all morning polishing it just for her . 
_t4 		once she was settled , he covered her with a warm blanket . 
_t4 		they took off across the powdery snow , Belle laughed happily as the beast guided the sleigh through the forest path . 
_t4 		soon they came to a clearing in the woods , before then was a frozen pond . 
_t4 		the beast pulled on the reins and stopped at the  the edge of the pond . 
_t4 		this is such a magical place , said Belle , how did you ever find it ? 
_t4 		I used to come here long ago , said the beast , it was one of y favorite places and I wanted to share it with you . 
_t4 		then the beast took out a picnic basket filled with snacks . 
_t4 		what are they eating ? 
_t4 		xxx they have hot chocolate . 
_t4 		and cookies .
_t4 
_t4 		right and +/.
_t4 
_t4 		and fruit and bread too !
_t4 
_t4 		that sounds like a good snack , doesn't it ? 
_t4 		mmmm yummy .
_t4 
_t4 		when they had finished their meal , the beast asked Belle if she wanted to ice skate . 
_t4 		oh yes , she said , father and I used to go every winter , I love ice skating . 
_t4 		soon Belle was spinning effortlessly across the pond's smooth surface . 
_t4 		the beast was less graceful , hitting a bump in the ice , he lost his balance and toppled to the ground . 
_t4 		at first he was angry , but then he saw Belle looking at him kindly . 
_t4 		remembering his friends' advice he smiled as Belle helped him to his feet . 
_t4 		every one falls sometimes , said Belle , it's part of learning . 
_t4 		before long they were gliding across the ice arm in arm , enjoying each other's company in the crisp winter air . 
_t4 		they grew tired and decided to rest . 
_t4 		just then , a timid fawn wandered out of the forest . 
_t4 		poor thing , said Belle , she looks scared and hungry . 
_t4 		taking an apple from their picnic basket , Belle showed the beast how to gently feed the young deer . 
_t4 		soon the sun was setting , it was time to go , as they made their way home , Belle thought about the day she had spent with the beast . 
_t4 		there was something different about him , he had shown her a kinder , softer side . 
_t4 		perhaps they could be friends after all . 
_t4 		is that what comes next ? 
_t4 		oh  .
_t4 
_t4 		what's this one called ? 
_t4 		right , is it called the dance lesson ? 
_t4 		mmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		how do you ask nicely ? 
_t4 		just imagine , said Cinderella excitedly , there's a ball at the palace tonight in honor of the prince . 
_t4 		and every maiden in the land is invited . 
_t4 		that means me too ! 
_t4 		all of Cinderella's friends clapped and chirped as they gathered around . 
_t4 		they loved their Cinderella . 
_t4 		oh dear said Cinderella with a sigh , there's so much to do ! 
_t4 		I can only go if I finish my chores . 
_t4 		and today , step mother has given me more work than ever . 
_t4 		there's washing , mending , ironing , cooking , scrubbing , sweeping . 
_t4 		suddenly , three loud shrieks came from downstairs . 
_t4 		Cinderella , come down here immediately and help us get ready for the ball , he step sisters cried . 
_t4 		mend my dress , polish my shoes , iron my cloak ! 
_t4 		hours later , Cinderella began to sweep and scrub the endless stone floor . 
_t4 		suddenly Jacques had an idea . 
_t4 		I know , he said , we'll help Cinderella , and all the other mice nodded in agreement . 
_t4 		what would I do without you , Cinderella said , patting them on the head , you're so good to me . 
_t4 		everyone joined in the cleaning , singing happily as they went . 
_t4 		as she worked , Cinderella began to imagine the magical evening ahead . 
_t4 		everyone would be dressed in the the finest clothes , Cinderella would wear her mother's beautiful gown . 
_t4 		the ballroom would come alive with music , dancing , and laughter and the handsome young prince would bow before Cinderella and ask her to dance . 
_t4 		suddenly Cinderella stopped dreaming ,  no she said , I've never been to a ball , I don't even know how to dance ! 
_t4 		don't worry Cinderella , Jacques smiled reassuringly . 
_t4 		we'll show you how to dance , easy as pie . 
_t4 		with that , Jacques bowed before Perla and extended his hand . 
_t4 		dance please , he asked , Perla blushed as she took Jaques' hand . 
_t4 		Gus was the conductor , he got all the birds to sing . 
_t4 		Jacques and Perla spun around and around gliding across the floor . 
_t4 		honey is the mouse's name Jack or Jacques ? 
_t4 		it's Jacques and Gus ? 
_t4 		ok .
_t4

_t4 		everyone but princess Ariel and her friend flounder . 
_t4 		hurry up , flounder , cried Ariel , it's almost time for the party we can't be late ! 
_t4 		trying not to make a sound , Ariel and flounder swam away from king Triton's palace . 
_t4 		they began their journey towards the surface , but Ariel , said flounder , are you sure we should go to the surface ? 
_t4 		remember the last time , your father got so angry ! 

_t4 		swim faster flounder , she cried , flounder raced to keep up . 
_t4 		just as Ariel and flounder approached the surface , Ariel saw beautiful lights dance across the water . 
_t4 		when they poked their heads out of the water , Ariel and flounder saw colorful lights explode in the air above prince Eric's castle . 
_t4 		I've never seen anything so beautiful in all my life , said Ariel . 
_t4 		the human world is a wonderful place . 
_t4 		sure is pretty , said flounder . 

_t4 		or do you .
_t4

_t4 		he's happy ,  good . 
_t4 		off in the distance , prince Eric stood on the palace balcony . 
_t4 		he couldn't stop thinking about the mysterious girl with the lovely voice who had saved his life in the ship wreck . 
_t4 		why has she disappeared , he wondered . 
_t4 		xxx . 

_t4 		Ariel's heart leapt with joy when she saw prince Eric . 

_t4 		swimming up to a nearby rock , Ariel and flounder hid behind it . 
_t4 		ready , asked flounder . 
_t4 		with a nod , Ariel closed her eyes , opened her mouth and began to sing . 

_t4 		suddenly the night was filled with the sweet sound of Ariel's voice . 
_t4 		she sang a song she had written just for Eric . 
_t4 		it was Ariel's special gift to him . 
_t4 		hearing her beautiful voice again , Eric's face lit up . 
_t4 		it can't be , he said , I must be hearing the sounds of the wind . 
_t4 		still , he remained on the balcony , enchanted by the beautiful song filling the night air . 
_t4 		when the song was over , Eric looked down across the sea . 
_t4 		he hoped to catch a glimpse of the wonderful girl who had saved him . 
_t4 		who are you , he called , but all he heard was the echo of his own voice . 
_t4 		I'll be back soon , Ariel whispered . 
_t4 		just wait and see ! 
_t4 		ok . 
_t4 		whatever could be keeping the dwarves , said Snow White . 
_t4 		it's getting late . 
_t4 		and they should be home from the diamond mine by now . 
_t4 		while she waited , Snow White busied herself tidying up the cottage in the woods . 
_t4 		what messy little fellows , she said . 
_t4 		just then , Happy came through the front door . 
_t4 		he tugged on Snow White's long , yellow skirt . 
_t4 		what ? 
_t4 		xxx Snow White , he said , come quickly , a young deer is hurt in the woods . 
_t4 		oh no , cried Snow White , the poor thing , we must hurry . 
_t4 		they soon reached a small clearing and everyone stood in a circle around the deer . 
_t4 		do you know what the dwarves' names are ? 
_t4 		well , I think there's Happy . 
_t4 		and there's Grumpy , he looks Grumpy right ? 
_t4 		and that's Dopey . 
_t4 		and that's Sneezy , he's always sneezing . 
_t4 		that's Doc , he's the doctor . 
_t4 		and there's Bashful . 
_t4 		and there's Sleepy , I think . 
_t4 		xxx .

_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		he is yawning (be)cause he's so tired . 
_t4 		oh  .

_t4 		he must be cold , said Snow White , covering the deer with her long cape . 
_t4 		maybe he's just tired , said Sleepy yawning . 
_t4 		a nice long rest should do the trick . 
_t4 		xxx mommy's yawning too . 
_t4 		xxx what a big yawn .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		xxx .

_t4 		his eyes .
_t4 
_t4 		and that's Dopey right ? 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		he looks like he might be a little bit stuffy . 
_t4 		well that's possible , but he probably would've stayed in his thicket until he was feeling better , said Snow White . 
_t4 		I know , said Happy , maybe he's feeling sad and needs a little cheering up . 
_t4 		I'm sure that would help , Happy , but it looks like he may need something more than a merry story or a song . 
_t4 		I  I don't know for sure , said Bashful softly . 
_t4 		but perhaps he's too shy to let us know what's the matter . 
_t4 		we all feel shy sometimes , don't we Bashful , said Snow White . 
_t4 		then Dopey started pacing back and forth and pointing over his shoulder . 
_t4 		hmmm said Snow White , you could be right Dopey . 
_t4 		he could be lost . 
_t4 		I bet I know what happened , grumbled Grumpy . 
_t4 		the wicked queen probably cast a spell on him . 
_t4 		she's always up to no good . 
_t4 		suddenly , Doc pushed his way past the others and approached the deer . 
_t4 		may I lake a took  . 
_t4 		I mean , take a look , he said adjusting his eye glasses . 
_t4 		and he knealt down beside the deer . 

_t4 		how relieved you must be , cried Snow White . 
_t4 		now run along home , she said to her new friend , your family must be worried . 
_t4 		the deer licked Snow White's hand and ran into the forest . 
_t4 		that's the deer . 
_t4 		oh ,  the bushes you mean ? 

_t4 
_t4 		yey . 
_t4 		oh what's this one about ? 
_t4 		it's about Jasmine , and what's his name ? 
_t4 		Aladdin . 
_t4 		Aladdin and Jasmine had just gotten married . 
_t4 		people had come from near and far to celebrate . 
_t4 		now Aladdin and Jasmine were preparing to take a trip far far away . 
_t4 		Abu , stay out of those bags , warned Aladdin , smiling at his curious little friend . 
_t4 		that food is for our trip . 
_t4 		Jasmine's going to be so surprised when she sees what I've planned .
_t4 		she has lived most of her life within the walls of this palace and now we are going to see the world together . 
_t4 		soon Aladdin and Jasmine stood on the balcony , ready to begin their adventure . 
_t4 		the magic carpet awaits you , said Aladdin . 
_t4 		you're going to see things you've never seen before , a whole new exciting world , Aladdin replied . 
_t4 		let's get going , said Jasmine , I can't wait . 
_t4 		Jasmine , Aladdin and Abu settled on the magic carpet . 
_t4 		then they took off , soaring high above the palace . 
_t4 		Jasmine laughed with delight , the wind blowing her long hair behind her . 
_t4 		look how small everything looks , she said . 
_t4 		it's like a dream . 
_t4 		after a little while , the magic carpet began its descent . 
_t4 		are we there , asked Jasmine . 
_t4 		almost , said Aladdin . 
_t4 		close your eyes , I want this to be a surprise . 
_t4 		suddenly the magic carpet landed on top of a high cliff and Jasmine heard a noise that sounded like crashing water . 
_t4 		oh , what is it ? 
_t4 		it's water , it's the ocean . 
_t4 		Jasmine couldn't believe her eyes , she'd never seen anything so beautiful . 
_t4 		the water was a brilliant shade of turquoise and dolphins leapt in and out of the water as if they were dancing . 

_t4 		they had a wonderful time swimming and enjoying the sun and . 
_t4 		when he and Jasmine were ready to go , Aladdin snapped his fingers . 
_t4 		time for our next destination , he said . 
_t4 		within seconds the magic carpet appeared . 
_t4 		once again , Aladdin asked Jasmine to cover her eyes , as they descended Jasmine felt the air grow colder . 
_t4 		ok Jasmine , you can open your eyes now . 
_t4 		what did they see ? 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 
_t4 		snow . 
_t4 		what is it , Jasmine asked bending down to touch the cold , white powder . 
_t4 		it's snow , answered Aladdin , isn't it wonderful ? 
_t4 		it falls from the sky when it's cold . 
_t4 		it's amazing , cried Jasmine , it looks like a soft , white cloud . 
_t4 		watch out , she called , Abu had thrown a snowball and it was headed straight for Aladdin . 
_t4 		they spent the rest of the day playing in the snow , and built snow+men and made snow+angels . 
_t4 		they even used the magic carpet as a sled to slide down a nearby hill . 
_t4 		I think it's time to take off , said Aladdin . 
_t4 		you show me places so different from Agraba . 
_t4 		there are plenty of brand new worlds for us to share , said Jasmine . 
_t4 		and as they made their way back to the palace , Jasmine smiled . 
_t4 		she knew this was just the beginning of their wonderful life together . 
_t4 		it was .
_t4 
_t4 		time to go , right , it was getting late . 

_t4 		Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes . 
_t4 		he had gone with his class to the bakery , the fire station , and the pet store . 
_t4 		today , Franklin's class was going to the museum . 
_t4 		Franklin was so excited that he could hardly eat his breakfast . 
_t4 		the museum had lots_of steps and huge doors . 
_t4 		wow: said Franklin , it's big . 
_t4 		it has to be , said Beaver , there are real dinosaurs in there . 
_t4 		do you remember in New York we went with grandma  and grandpa  to the museum with the dinosaurs ? 
_t4 		yeah , that's called the museum of natural history in new+york . 
_t4 		Beaver had been to the museum before , she knew everything about it . 
_t4 		bi:g dinosaurs , she emphasized . 
_t4 		so big that they ate trees for breakfast . 
_t4 		Franklin was afraid to ask what dinosaurs ate for lunch . 
_t4 		Franklin sat down on the steps . 
_t4 		what's wrong , asked Snail . 
_t4 		Beaver says there are real dinosaurs in the museum . 
_t4 		Snail looked alarmed . 
_t4 		that sounds scary . 
_t4 		and Franklin nodded . 
_t4 		we're not gonna get that . 
_t4 		in the museum lobby , mr Owl went over the rules . 
_t4 		no shouting , no running , and stay with the group . 
_t4 		mr Owl said , Beaver , one more thing . 
_t4 		watch out for the dinosaurs ! 
_t4 		Moose and Bear laughed . 
_t4 		but Franklin didn't , he moved a little closer to mr Owl . 
_t4 		their first stop was the bat cave . 
_t4 		it was dark inside . 
_t4 		squeaks and squawks filled the air . 
_t4 		what's that , asked Franklin . 
_t4 		Beaver giggled . 
_t4 		that's the sound bats make to find their way around . 
_t4 		Franklin was relieved that it was bats , and not dinosaurs . 
_t4 		the class visited the rainforest next . 
_t4 		Franklin climbed high into a tree house . 
_t4 		he could see the tops of trees . 
_t4 		can you spot any dinosaurs , asked Snail . 
_t4 		Franklin shook his head and climbed down quickly . 
_t4 		there was so much to do in the museum that Franklin almost forgot about the dinosaurs . 
_t4 		in the medieval room , Franklin had fun dressing up like a knight . 
_t4 		xxx (.) we saw knights in the other museum in new+york , at the Metropolitan , right ? 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		Franklin even got_to dig in a sandy pit . 
_t4 		he was the first one to find an arrow head . 
_t4 		it was just like being a real archaeologist . 
_t4 		wow that's neat . 
_t4 		an archeologist is when you dig in the sand for very old things . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		the best part is still to come , said Beaver as they sat down in the cafeteria . 
_t4 		yes agreed Bear , lunch . 
_t4 		mr Owl smiled , I think Beaver means the dinosaur exhibit . 
_t4 		Franklin gulped , I'm too tired to see more , I think I'll stay here a while , he muttered . 
_t4 		me too , said Snail . 
_t4 		you'll forget about being tired when you see the dinosaurs , said mr Owl . 
_t4 		eat up and let's go . 
