_t4 		(o)kay , Franklin's class trip . 
_t4 		Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes . 
_t4 		he had gone with his class to the bakery , the fire station , and the pet store . 
_t4 		today , Franklin's class was going to the museum . 
_t4 		Franklin was so excited that he could hardly eat his breakfast . 
_t4 		the museum had lots_of steps and huge doors . 
_t4 		wow: said Franklin , it's big . 
_t4 		it has to be , said Beaver , there are real dinosaurs in there . 
_t4 		do you remember in New York we went with grandma  and grandpa  to the museum with the dinosaurs ? 
_t4 		yeah , that's called the museum of natural history in new+york . 
_t4 		Beaver had been to the museum before , she knew everything about it . 
_t4 		bi:g dinosaurs , she emphasized . 
_t4 		so big that they ate trees for breakfast . 
_t4 		Franklin was afraid to ask what dinosaurs ate for lunch . 
_t4 		Franklin sat down on the steps . 
_t4 		what's wrong , asked Snail . 
_t4 		Beaver says there are real dinosaurs in the museum . 
_t4 		Snail looked alarmed . 
_t4 		that sounds scary . 
_t4 		and Franklin nodded . 
_t4 		we're not gonna get that . 
_t4 		in the museum lobby , mr Owl went over the rules . 
_t4 		no shouting , no running , and stay with the group . 
_t4 		mr Owl said , Beaver , one more thing . 
_t4 		watch out for the dinosaurs ! 
_t4 		Moose and Bear laughed . 
_t4 		but Franklin didn't , he moved a little closer to mr Owl . 
_t4 		their first stop was the bat cave . 
_t4 		it was dark inside . 
_t4 		squeaks and squawks filled the air . 
_t4 		what's that , asked Franklin . 
_t4 		Beaver giggled . 
_t4 		that's the sound bats make to find their way around . 
_t4 		Franklin was relieved that it was bats , and not dinosaurs . 
_t4 		the class visited the rainforest next . 
_t4 		Franklin climbed high into a tree house . 
_t4 		he could see the tops of trees . 
_t4 		can you spot any dinosaurs , asked Snail . 
_t4 		Franklin shook his head and climbed down quickly . 
_t4 		there was so much to do in the museum that Franklin almost forgot about the dinosaurs . 
_t4 		in the medieval room , Franklin had fun dressing up like a knight . 
_t4 		xxx (.) we saw knights in the other museum in new+york , at the Metropolitan , right ? 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		Franklin even got_to dig in a sandy pit . 
_t4 		he was the first one to find an arrow head . 
_t4 		it was just like being a real archaeologist . 
_t4 		wow that's neat . 
_t4 		an archeologist is when you dig in the sand for very old things . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		the best part is still to come , said Beaver as they sat down in the cafeteria . 
_t4 		yes agreed Bear , lunch . 
_t4 		mr Owl smiled , I think Beaver means the dinosaur exhibit . 
_t4 		Franklin gulped , I'm too tired to see more , I think I'll stay here a while , he muttered . 
_t4 		me too , said Snail . 
_t4 		you'll forget about being tired when you see the dinosaurs , said mr Owl . 
_t4 		eat up and let's go . 
_t4 		reluctantly , Franklin and Snail followed the giant footprints down a long , leafy corridor . 
_t4 		there was a loud roar . 
_t4 		the floor shook and so did Franklin . 
_t4 		a:h ! 
_t4 		screamed Franklin when he turned the corner . 
_t4 		he was looking right into the bony mouth of a tyrannosaurus . 
_t4 		Franklin blinked . 
_t4 		they're bones ? 
_t4 		real dinosaur bones ? 
_t4 		but the dinosaurs aren't even alive ! 
_t4 		alive giggled Beaver , of course not . 
_t4 		there hasn't been a live dinosaur for millions of years . 
_t4 		you sure make good jokes , Franklin . 
_t4 		you sure do , said Snail . 
_t4 		as they were leaving , Franklin and his friends walked past the egyp(tian) +//. 
_t4 		the egyptian exhibit .
_t4 
_t4 		next time , said Beaver , you should visit the tomb , there's a mummy inside . 
_t4 		is it real , asked Franklin . 
_t4 		yeah , and it's scary , said Beaver . 
_t4 		but Franklin wasn't scared . 
_t4 		he had a mummy at home . 
_t4 		and he har(dly) , could hardly wait to tell her all about his adventures at the museum . 
