_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		okay , you're all buckled i:n . 
_t4 		you're a buckled in girl .

_t4 		who's in her bed at the hospital ? 
_t4 		Isabelle ?
_t4 		I see .
_t4 		o:h .

_t4 		are you in the hospital , Emma ? 
_t4 		taped up ears ? 
_t4 		oh , did you take that off ? 
_t4 		come here .
_t4 		how did you take that off all by yourself ? 
_t4 		what kinds of medicine did you take , Isabelle ? 
_t4 		she slept ? 
_t4 		today is Friday , June fourth , two+thousand+four . 
_t4 		Isabelle scratched on the wall . 
_t4 		that's cause she hasn't had her second breakfast yet . 
_t4 		Isabelle , would you like a new puzzle ? 
_t4 		it has a certain somebody on it that you like . 
_t4 		wanna do it together ? 
_t4 		let's [: let us] do it in the hall . 
_t4 		what kind of a creature is that ? 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 		yep [: yes] . 
_t4 		now , we can put it together , but you know , we're gonna have_to take it up so the floor can be washed a little later . 
_t4 		should we do it somewhere where we don't have_to pick it up ? 
_t4 		instead ?
_t4 		I wonder how big it is . 
_t4 		lemme [: let me] just see .
_t4 		finished size , ten+and+a+third by fourteen+and+a+half .
_t4 		I wonder if we had a really big board we could use it . 
_t4 		I have an idea .
_t4 		I have a tray we could do it in .
_t4 		whoop , did that come off ? 
_t4 		here , lemme [: let me] fix it .
_t4 		well +... 
_t4 		I'm gonna put it on your bottom . 
_t4 		turn around .
_t4 		you know what I was thinking ? 
_t4 		I was thinking a little later if you want we could go to Earthly Delights for you second breakfast .
_t4 		would you like that ?
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 		really ? 
_t4 		she could come . 
_t4 		that way , we can move it around and take it off the floor when we're done . 
_t4 		see this little tray with the elephants on it ? 
_t4 		I'm gonna go get the tape (.) recorder and bring it in here . 
_t4 		here are all the pieces . 
_t4 		spread them all out and put them all face+up . 
_t4 		lemme [: let me] +//. 
_t4 		I'll be right back , Emma .
_t4 		let's [: let us] see . 
_t4 		no , we're gonna do it together . 
_t4 		where's my mic ? 
_t4 		here it is .
_t4 		yeah , we'll do it together .
_t4 		um , it's plastic actually . 
_t4 		it's plastic .
_t4 		all+right , let's [: let us] look at that picture that it's supposed to look like . 
_t4 		like that , okay .
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		mmmm , this looks like kind+of a hard puzzle . 
_t4 		I'm going to .
_t4 		let's [: let us] see . 
_t4 		you know what the easiest place to start I think would be ?
_t4 		see how there's pink flowers only on the left side of the picture ? 
_t4 		why don't we find all the pieces that have part of the pink flower in them ?
_t4 		yeah !
_t4 		well put it on the tray . 
_t4 		we're gonna make it on the tray so that we can move it when we're done if we want to .
_t4 		here +//. 
_t4 		oh that's a bird .
_t4 		there's pink flower .
_t4 		here's some pink flower . 
_t4 		here's some too .
_t4 		first I'm just finding all the pieces . 
_t4 		up , there's a tiny bit of pink flower in that piece .
_t4 		teeny tiny . 
_t4 		this puzzle has sixty pieces ! 
_t4 		hey , you did it ! 
_t4 		you put three of the pink flower pieces together . 
_t4 		well , this needs to be an edge , doesn't it ? 
_t4 		what about this ? 
_t4 		excuse me , your hair and head is right in the way . 
_t4 		I can't see the puzzle at all .
_t4 		thank+you . 
_t4 		there . 
_t4 		see , that's that edge . 
_t4 		and here's a bud . 
_t4 		where's this flower bud in the picture ? 
_t4 		is it +//? 
_t4 		oh , it's down there .
_t4 		so , I think this is a bottom piece .
_t4 		o:h , good .
_t4 		that's good . 
_t4 		up , here's another flower piece .
_t4 		oh , you made it connect . 
_t4 		this one goes down here because it's this bud .
_t4 		there's two birds , so let's [: let us] look for +/.
_t4 		let's find all the bird pieces next .
_t4 		oops , sorry .
_t4 		I just put all the bird pieces in one spot for now .
_t4 		uh , sorry . 
_t4 		bird mird ? 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 		he:y , we got a lot of pieces together .
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 		some fruit of some kind . 
_t4 		now , let's [: let us] see . 
_t4 		there's a bird near this petal .
_t4 		I think , is it +//? 
_t4 		yeah , this bird must be near this .
_t4 		and this bird should have more bird body .
_t4 		does this go to this ? 
_t4 		I think this part +... 
_t4 		this is this other bird .
_t4 		let's [: let us] find the birds . 
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		I think that goes there . 
_t4 		and this might go here . 
_t4 		I think +...
_t4 		I think this piece +//. 
_t4 		I think I found a beak over there .
_t4 		see ? 
_t4 		all that piece has is beak . 
_t4 		this is another part of a bird . 
_t4 		do you think it goes here ? 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm .
_t4 		I think we could find a corner piece that might +//. 
_t4 		oh wait .
_t4 		this is a corner piece that must go up here . 
_t4 		the bird's body is (.) there .
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] see . 
_t4 		hmmm .
_t4 		let's find other cor(ners) +//. 
_t4 		oh wait , there's a tiny bit of pink flower .
_t4 		where is that pink flower ?
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		xxx is it an edge piece or not ?
_t4 		does it have one sm(ooth) , one flat side ? 
_t4 		let's [: let us] look at the picture of the cover , on the cover , and see where a piece of bud belongs . 
_t4 		I got that one up here .
_t4 		up there ? 
_t4 		oh , you're right .
_t4 		and there's fur on it . 
_t4 		he:y . 
_t4 		right there . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm .
_t4 		oh here's another edge , I mean corner piece .
_t4 		I wonder if that's the corner piece for the bottom left . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		I think upside down and sideways . 
_t4 		like that ? 
_t4 		and I think (.) this corner piece might go +//. 
_t4 		oh wait , maybe not .
_t4 		I think maybe this is the corner piece for this side . 
_t4 		I don't know if it goes there .
_t4 		I think we need more fur .
_t4 		we need a bottom piece with more fur . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] see . 
_t4 		like that . 
_t4 		xxx bottom piece .
_t4 		now see if this corner piece goes . 
_t4 		he:y . 
_t4 		uh+huh ?
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		mmmm , you need some white to match that . 
_t4 		here's a corner piece . 
_t4 		where +//? 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 		how bout [: about] up in this part ?
_t4 		maybe . 
_t4 		we're still missing one more corner piece . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] find the corner piece .
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		I don't see it .
_t4 		wait , this is a corner piece . 
_t4 		this must go here .
_t4 		probably missing one edge piece here .
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 		let's [: let us] see . 
_t4 		hmmm , there's a side piece . 
_t4 		that goes there .
_t4 		well , it's [: it has] gotta go right on the edge , doesn't it ? 
_t4 		along that edge I think . 
_t4 		wait a minute . 
_t4 		I think that's a black ear . 
_t4 		I think that goes up here .
_t4 		aha . 
_t4 		see look , there's the black ear ?
_t4 		so that's the top part . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm .
_t4 		feels like we're missing pieces though . 
_t4 		are we sitting on any ?
_t4 		oh !
_t4 		you were sitting on one piece . 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 		I don't know . 
_t4 		oh , it looks like the other +/. 
_t4 		is it the other ear ?
_t4 		or part of this ear ? 
_t4 		check here .
_t4 		does it fit in to that ? 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		no .
_t4 		does this go here ? 
_t4 		it does . 
_t4 		and that goes there .
_t4 		the whole top edge is done now .
_t4 		Naima , how about if that +//?
_t4 		yeah , is it right ? 
_t4 		no .
_t4 		it's too loose to fit . 
_t4 		how bout [: about] +..?
_t4 		I don't think we have a place to put that one yet . 
_t4 		it looks like an ear . 
_t4 		maybe it's the other +//.
_t4 		maybe it goes +...
_t4 		look and see how the brown branch connects to the black ear ?
_t4 		that's this right here . 
_t4 		o:h . 
_t4 		it does go there . 
_t4 		yes . 
_t4 		I think so ,  .
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_t4 		I checked . 
_t4 		I'm not .
_t4 		I'll check again if you want me to .
_t4 		no , I'm not . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		yeah . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] see here .
_t4 		those two go +//. 
_t4 		no , they don't go .
_t4 		they look like they go , but they don't .
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		no , it doesn't go . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		I don't know . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] find more edge pieces .
_t4 		there have_to be at least a few . 
_t4 		this is an edge piece , this is an edge piece , this is an edge piece .
_t4 		o:h , a very small amount of pink , uh+huh .
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		that doesn't go . 
_t4 		sometimes you just have_to try a+lot of pieces and see what , what fits . 
_t4 		does that go ? 
_t4 		yeah , I guess it does go . 
_t4 		that's nice , isn't it ? 
_t4 		oh , we still need some edge pieces to be found . 
_t4 		this is another edge piece . 
_t4 		where it goes , I don't know .
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		how bout [: about] there ? 
_t4 		oh , that goes .
_t4 		oh I wonder if this now goes here . 
_t4 		ya:y !
_t4 		it's starting to look more like the picture , isn't it ? 
_t4 		that doesn't go there .
_t4 		I think the  be +/.
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		some black , we need an edge piece that has a little black in it .
_t4 		do you s(ee) +/.
_t4 		but that didn't look like an edge piece .
_t4 		this is an edge piece .
_t4 		oh ,  , an ear ? 
_t4 		how about on there ? 
_t4 		will it attach to that ear ?
_t4 		I think s(o) +//. 
_t4 		no ?
_t4 		are you sure ?
_t4 		let's see .
_t4 		you were right , it doesn't go there . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		certainly , the first time you do a puzzle is the hardest I think . 
_t4 		do you think so ? 
_t4 		Daddy will be very surprised . 
_t4 		that doesn't go there . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		that goes .
_t4 		all that bluish . 
_t4 		I still don't understand what piece goes there , though .
_t4 		cause there's a+lot of fur involved . 
_t4 		xxx , that doesn't really go . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		I think we're missing an edge piece that has black in it . 
_t4 		those don't have any edges . 
_t4 		well I hope we weren't missing a piece when it was a new puzzle . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] lift up and look and see if we +... 
_t4 		somehow did we miss some ? 
_t4 		look behind you , where the other box is . 
_t4 		are there any pieces under that ? 
_t4 		guess not . 
_t4 		okay , maybe we're just missing a piece . 
_t4 		well , we could still put together most of it . 
_t4 		even if we're missing +/.
_t4 		well I wanna keep going .
_t4 		I wanna keep going and see what we can do . 
_t4 		that goes there .
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		where's the picture ?
_t4 		maybe this , maybe this connects over here .
_t4 		no . 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm .
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm ?
_t4 		hmmm ? 
_t4 		oh , this goes here .
_t4 		I think this goes here . 
_t4 		o:h , is it part of an ear ? 
_t4 		does it go over here ? 
_t4 		it's [: it has] got white . 
_t4 		the white is part of the face of the panda .
_t4 		does it ? 
_t4 		mmmm +...
_t4 		it's a little bit loose .
_t4 		how bout [: about] +/?
_t4 		how bout [: about] +/?
_t4 		it's a very white part . 
_t4 		but with a little black . 
_t4 		I'm not sure we have a place for that .
_t4 		where does the panda have stripes ?
_t4 		so that goes somewhere here . 
_t4 		jaw piece . 
_t4 		actually that looks right .
_t4 		where's that +/? 
_t4 		oh , that's the nose , where +/.
_t4 		see where it gets very very bluish white ?
_t4 		that must be the nose . 
_t4 		try over here , Naima . 
_t4 		what about here ?
_t4 		oh , no , I guess not . 
_t4 		all+right .
_t4 		mmmm . 
_t4 		we got two ears already . 
_t4 		oh , here's another edge piece . 
_t4 		it's really hard to spot them . 
_t4 		that goes there , I think . 
_t4 		this go here ?
_t4 		not really ,  .
_t4 		no ,  . 
_t4 		this is +//.
_t4 		oh , but this goes here .
_t4 		and this goes here . 
_t4 		and we need one more edge piece right there .
_t4 		hmmm .
_t4 		it must have some white and some black , do you see ? 
_t4 		well , that goes there . 
_t4 		and this goes this way . 
_t4 		I think +...
_t4 		uh . 
_t4 		we're getting there , Naima ! 
_t4 		we have more +//. 
_t4 		I think more than half the pieces are put together .
_t4 		do you think so ?
_t4 		you're right . 
_t4 		and it has to be an edge , too .
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		oh .
_t4 		this is an edge . 
_t4 		try that on the side there .
_t4 		okay , that means we've [: we have] done all the edges . 
_t4 		look .
_t4 		all four edges .
_t4 		that's something .
_t4 		at least we did that . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		it's pretty white , isn't it ? 
_t4 		hmmm .
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		it's like putting the cars down in the right street ?
_t4 		xxx . 
_t4 		he:y . 
_t4 		o:h !
_t4 		that goes very nicely right there . 
_t4 		something must go there somehow . 
_t4 		hmmm , it must have some sky and it must have some white .
_t4 		so the bluish and the white it has to have . 
_t4 		how about that ?
_t4 		no ?
_t4 		bluish and has to have some white . 
_t4 		oh , and it has to have a tiny bit of black .
_t4 		how about this ? 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		how bout [: about] over here , Naima ?
_t4 		try it there .
_t4 		well , I think +... 
_t4 		well , maybe not .
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		this is not a particularly easy puzzle , is it ?
_t4 		I'm gonna try this here .
_t4 		how bout [: about] there ? 
_t4 		oh no maybe not cause that's its belly .
_t4 		it has to be a place where there's blue sky .
_t4 		it might go over here somewhere .
_t4 		he:y .
_t4 		good job . 
_t4 		I think that goes there . 
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		Daddy left his tv on downstairs . 
_t4 		that doesn't go there . 
_t4 		that goes there . 
_t4 		let's [: let us] see , that has some white fur and some black +//. 
_t4 		oh , that has the eye , Naima .
_t4 		you've [: you have] got the eye piece . 
_t4 		how bout [: about] there ?
_t4 		no it  probably go , no . 
_t4 		well , the other eye should be over here somewhere . 
_t4 		yes , I know I know .
_t4 		that goes there . 
_t4 		that's where it goes .
_t4 		we only have one , two , three , four , five +...
_t4 		I think we have nine . 
_t4 		look .
_t4 		one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight +... 
_t4 		nine .
_t4 		we're almost done .
_t4 		mmmm+(o)kay .
_t4 		I don't know .
_t4 		you have a runny nose again . 
_t4 		good . 
_t4 		try this corner .
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm . 
_t4 		I think so .
_t4 		hmmm . 
_t4 		xxx we should celebrate when we're done ?
_t4 		ya:y , we did i:t ! 
_t4 		we did the whole puzzle . 
_t4 		sixty pieces . 
_t4 		that was fun .
_t4 		no , let's [: let us] not .
_t4 		this way we can save it and put it up if we want to save it to look at . 
_t4 		xxx .
_t4 		you wanna pretend ? 
_t4 		we didn't ? 
_t4 		we did i:t ! 
_t4 		yep [: yes] , could you count how many more we could fit (.) if we wanted to ?
_t4 		you only need +//.
_t4 		lemme [: let me] give you a hint .
_t4 		you +...
_t4 		you actually don't have very many more . 
_t4 		well , if we get some more they'll have a place there , won't they ? 
_t4 		is that right ? 
_t4 		you just got +//.
_t4 		you just did a new one , sweetie .
_t4 		I think we should open the window a little cause it's so nice outside . 
_t4 		yes .
_t4 		these windows do have screens . 
_t4 		we don't have_to worry about that . 
_t4 		I haven't seen that in a long time .
_t4 		do you remember that book ? 
_t4 		Naima's Knight . 
_t4 		I think you actually probably have it memorized . 
_t4 		you know that book so well . 
_t4 		Naima's Knight . 
_t4 		look at all the stickers !
_t4 		why does it have all those stickers on ? 
_t4 		do you remember ?
_t4 		why did you put stickers on ?

_t4 		it probably looks very bright when you come out . 
_t4 		oh , my baby !

_t4 		you don't wanna decide ? 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 		hello .
