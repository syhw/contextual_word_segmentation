_d4087 		right here .
_d4087 		well and you definitely would not hear me without the microphone here . 
_d4087 		so this transmitter itself is not the problem . 
_d4087 		if this sound is working . 
_d4087 		okay (.) now we're gonna go back . 
_d4087 		and replay that . 
_d4087 		okay (.) the only difference with this test is that +... 
_d4087 		on the receiver (.) from the last session you just heard was that on the receiver +... 
_d4087 		the f two switch is on off .
_d4087

_d4087 		you shouldn't be able to hear me +//.
_d4087 
_d4087 		if I +...

_d4088 
_d4088 		okay this is a test of +... 
_d4088 		the transmitter which is on f+one right now . 
_d4088 		and you definitely should not be able to hear this if there's a problem . 
_d4088 		now this should be fine cause [: because] I just tested it . 
_d4088 		xxx this is the one that I thought was not working because it had a new battery +... 
_d4088 		but I did just change the battery , so it has a second new battery , which may have been the problem .

_d4088 		which is bizarre in and of itself +//.
_d4088 
_d4088 		it may be a separate problem . 

_d4088 		I'm going to walk away . 
_d4088 		and if you can't hear this +... 

_d4088 		receiver is not functioning properly . 
_d4088 		right ? 
_d4088 		okay stop . 
_d4088 		okay a double test of the hypothesis that the f+two channel on the receiver is the malfunction . 
_d4088 		I've just switched transmitters . 
_d4088 		the one I have , I'm putting onto f+two . 
_d4088 		both green lights on the receiver are on . 
