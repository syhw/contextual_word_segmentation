_t4 		I might just try one . 
_t4 		if they came all the way from Jupiter . 
_t4 		not bad she said . 
_t4 		and took another bite . 
_t4 		then Lola saw some peas , I don't eat peas said Lola . 
_t4 		I said these are not peas , of course they're not , these are green drops from Greenland . 
_t4 		they're made out of green and they fall from the sky . 
_t4 		but I don't eat green things , Lola said . 
_t4 		oh goody , then I'll have your share , green drops are so incredibly rare .
_t4 
_t4 		that's Charlie . 
_t4 		maybe I'll just nibble on one or two she said .
