_t4 		it must be on the docks here . 
_t4 		I'm the fastest train here , so I will have_to take the package . 
_t4 		Gordon took the package and set off immediately . 
_t4 		Thomas was left behind ! 
_t4 		I could have gotten it there quickly , he peeped . 
_t4 		Gordon hurried down the track and took a hilly shortcut . 
_t4 		suddenly , he saw a red signal . 
_t4 		some rocks had fallen across his path ! 
_t4 		he was stuck ! 
_t4 		just then , Toby came by on an open truck . 
_t4 		help , said Gordon ! 
_t4 		I have an urgent package for Sir Topham Hatt .
_t4 
_t4 		I'll take it down the hill , said Toby . 

_t4 		Gordon called as Toby chugged away . 
_t4 		what's that ? 
_t4 		what's that , Ethan ? 
_t4 		a waterfall , like we saw yesterday , yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		Percy was waiting at the bottom . 
_t4 		thank you for bringing the urgent package down , said Percy . 
_t4 		now I can take it to Sir Topham Hatt .
_t4 
_t4 		Sir Topham Hatt will be very proud of me , Percy tooted as he hurried along . 
_t4 		toot , toot , no , he doesn't say toot , he says peep .
_t4 
_t4 		Percy rounded a bend and saw James ahead of him , pulling two troublesome trucks . 
_t4 		yep [: yes] , they're in the way .
_t4 
_t4 		James was going very slowly , because the trucks had their brakes on . 
_t4 		they were trying to stop James . 
_t4 		we want to take the package , said the troublesome trucks .
_t4 
_t4 		we won't release our brakes until you give it to us .
_t4 
_t4 		they wouldn't go until they took the package . 
_t4 		Percy was very mad . 
_t4 		but he knew that the urgent package had to get to Sir Topham Hatt quickly . 
_t4 		with a sigh ,  , he gave it to the trucks . 
_t4 		no more trouble from you , trucks , said James . 
_t4 		the trucks released their brakes . 
_t4 		James and the trucks quickly left Percy behind . 
_t4 		was Thomas listening to the story too ? 
_t4 		James was glad he would be the one to deliver this urgent package now . 
_t4 		James was going so fast , he almost didn't see +... 

_t4 		the broken track , right .

_t4 		the broken track ! 

_t4 
_t4 		now Sir Topham Hatt will never get his urgent package ! 
_t4 		I'll take the urgent package , said Harold , landing next to James . 
_t4 		he took the package and flew off .
_t4 
_t4 		Harold soared over the countryside . 
_t4 		Thomas had been faster than Gordon after all ! 
_t4 		where's my package , Sir Topham Hatt said . 
_t4 		just then , Harold landed . 
_t4 		I have it , sir , he said . 
_t4 		and he told Thomas and Sir Topham Hatt what happened . 
_t4 		finally , Sir Topham Hatt opened the urgent package . 
_t4 		what could be inside ?
_t4 
_t4 		a new hat , right !
_t4 
_t4 		it's a shiny new hat ! 
_t4 		just in time for tonight's big party , Sir Topham Hatt said , putting the hat on his head . 

_t4 		I want you: to bring it ! 

_t4 		yes , no , a maybe so . 
_t4 		that's just a design .

_t4 		it's a design , an(d) what's that , Ethan ? 
_t4 		mmmm+hmmm , a one [?] .
_t4 
_t4 		an(d) what's this design ? 

_t4 		Toby and the flood ? 
_t4 		it had been raining hard for weeks . 
_t4 		Toby was feeling miserable . 
_t4 		everywhere was +... 
_t4 		wet . 
_t4 		wet . 
_t4 		wet . 
_t4 		that's a dam . 
_t4 		an(d) the water's coming through . 
_t4 		it's like a big wall , an(d) the water is pouring through . 
_t4 		only the great wall , known as a dam , was stopping the water from overflowing . 
_t4 		Percy arrived just as Toby was about to expect the dam for any damage . 
_t4 		driver tells me it may be dangerous up there , careful Toby ! 
_t4 		I'll try , said Toby bravely . 
_t4 		Percy watched anxiously as Toby trundled away . 
_t4 		there he goes , over that bridge . 
_t4 		his journey took him over a wooden bridge at the edge of the village .
_t4 
_t4 		the river surged dangerously beneath it . 
_t4 		the water's getting higher and higher .
_t4 
_t4 		the river's getting higher and higher .
_t4 
_t4 		just like in the +//. 
_t4 		just like in that other story .
_t4 
_t4 		the ,  , what story ? 
_t4 		about the tugboat . 
_t4 		Harold the Helicopter was inspecting the dam as Toby arrived . 
_t4 		be brave , Toby , called his driver . 
_t4 		we have_to cross to the other side .
_t4 
_t4 		the dam did not look safe at all , and Toby was worried . 
_t4 		soon , he knew why .
_t4 
_t4 		it broke . 
_t4 		see , the wall broke .
_t4 
_t4 		the dam's breaking up ! 
_t4 		we must warn everyone !
_t4 
_t4 		Toby shunted back as fast as his wheels would let him . 
_t4 		Percy was waiting anxiously for Toby by the bridge .
_t4 
_t4 		the river had risen so high that the bridge was in danger of collapsing . 
_t4 		the dam's breaking up , we must find high ground ! 
_t4 		your only chance is to cross the bridge , called Toby . 
_t4 		called Percy . 
_t4 		it doesn't look safe to me , wailed Toby .
_t4 
_t4 		yeah .
_t4 
_t4 		Thomas , look at it break up like that , an(d) the water's rushing through . 
_t4 		it's our only chance , said his driver . 
_t4 		if the dam breaks , we'll be +...
_t4 
_t4 		we'll be +... 
_t4 		done for , yep .
_t4 
_t4 		Toby was halfway across when disaster struck . 
_t4 		help , called Toby .
_t4 
_t4 		we'll follow him on our line . 
_t4 		it meets the river further down .
_t4 
_t4 		as Toby floated helplessly in the floodwaters , they passed a sign that made them shudder . 
_t4 		what does it say ? 
_t4 		beware the waterfall , that's right .
_t4 
_t4 		if we go over that waterfall , we're +... 
_t4 		doomed ,  .
_t4 
_t4 		swooped .
_t4 
_t4 		you wanna lie down ?
_t4 
_t4 		okay .
_t4 
_t4 		you're a tired little pumpkin today , huh ? 
_t4 		let's see . 
_t4 		we're gonna drop a rope to you .
_t4 
_t4 		attach it to yourself .
_t4 
_t4 		quickly , now .
_t4 
_t4 		and they did . 
_t4 		to one of Toby's buffers .
_t4 
_t4 		just then , Percy arrived . 
_t4 		Harold flew over to him . 
_t4 		catch the rope and pull Toby to safety ! 
_t4 		he called . 
_t4 		Toby was safe at last .
_t4 
_t4 		see ?
_t4 
_t4 		Percy's pulling Toby .
_t4 
_t4 		an(d) he's attached to a rope . 
_t4 		when the floods were over and the dam mended , the villagers had a big party for Toby , hosted by Sir Topham Hatt . 
_t4 		you were very brave , Toby . 
_t4 		thanks to Harold !
_t4 
_t4 		I never could've been so brave , Toby , said Percy .
_t4 
_t4 		oh , I'm sure you would be . 
_t4 		but you never know (un)til you've tried .
_t4 
_t4 		Percy rather hoped he would never have_to ! 
_t4 		what story's this ? 
_t4 		a better view for Gordon , that's right .
_t4 
_t4 		Gordon was feeling grumpy . 
_t4 		this was making James cross .
_t4 
_t4 		why are you complaining all the time ? 
_t4 		because I'm a big engine and I know everything . 
_t4 		I shall complain whenever I want . 
_t4 		you're just a small engine with ideas above your station .
_t4 
_t4 		I can't see any , said Percy , where are they ? 
_t4 		any what ? 
_t4 		ideas , above the station .
_t4 
_t4 		the sky's empty .
_t4 
_t4 		like your smoke+box , Percy ! 
_t4 		laughed James . 
_t4 		but Gordon was still grumpy !
_t4 
_t4 		one day I'll show you just what a big engine can really do . 
_t4 		not speak to silly little green +//. 
_t4 		so what can a big engine really do ?
_t4 
_t4 		not speak to silly little green engines , for a start , replied Gordon .
_t4 
_t4 		then he puffed away . 
_t4 		later that day , Sir Topham Hatt came to see him . 
_t4 		Gordon , you'll be making one stop today , with an empty express , to test our new station . 
_t4 		you can make up time afterwards . 
_t4 		why can't Henry do it ? 
_t4 		he likes idling in stations .
_t4 
_t4 		you will do as you are told . 
_t4 		so Gordon did , but he was still unhappy . 
_t4 		an(d) he grew sick , too ! 
_t4 		Gordon was sick ! 
_t4 		mmmm , can you see his face ?
_t4 
_t4 		there it is .
_t4 
_t4 		he's making a funny face . 
_t4 		mmmm .
_t4 
_t4 		I can't do it ,  . 
_t4 		do I look like Gordon ? 
_t4 		xxx , you look funny too ! 
_t4 		I just can't get up to speed , he moaned . 
_t4 		it's time for your visit to the works .
_t4 
_t4 		he moaned , and he groaned .
_t4 
_t4 		your pipes are clogged , said the fireman . 
_t4 		at last , they approached the new station . 
_t4 		Gordon was impressed , but his mood soon changed . 
_t4 		in front of him was a blank wall an(d) huge buffers . 
_t4 		what a boring view ! 
_t4 		important engines like me should have a panoramic view , where I can see people and people can see me . 
_t4 		weesh !
_t4 
_t4 		weesh ! 
_t4 		Gordon was happy when it was time to leave . 
_t4 		now you can really enjoy your run , as long as your pipes will let you , said his driver . 
_t4 		come on , come on , I can go faster than this , puffed Gordon . 
_t4 		sick ? 
_t4 		me ?
_t4 
_t4 		never .
_t4 
_t4 		but Gordon began to feel more and more feeble . 
_t4 		that means weak . 
_t4 		soon , he came to a complete stop .
_t4 
_t4 		what happened ? 
_t4 		his driver and his fireman inspected him . 
_t4 		something's broken inside you , said the fireman .
_t4 
_t4 		now you really will have_to go to the works . 
_t4 		Gordon was still angry when James arrived to collect his cookies . 
_t4 		well , well , well ! 
_t4 		so much for knowing about everything !
_t4 
_t4 		you got too puffed up in your boiler , so it serves you right . 
_t4 		serves you right , serves you right ! 
_t4 		when Gordon returned from the works a few days later , he was still boasting . 
_t4 		probably the finest in the world ! 
_t4 		come on , Gordon , we're going to the new official opening of the station . 
_t4 		then there was trouble ! 
_t4 		as Gordon approached the station . 
_t4 		neither the fire +//.
_t4 
_t4 		driver or the fireman could apply his brakes .
_t4 
_t4 		something had jammed !
_t4 
_t4 		the driver reduced steam , but Gordon was still going too fast ! 
_t4 		help me , please ! 
_t4 		he pleaded to him .
_t4 
_t4 		well , Gordon , said Sir Topham Hatt , I knew you wanted a panoramic view , but this is not the way to achieve it . 
_t4 		what did Gordon say ? 
_t4 		yes , so sorry , sir !
_t4 
_t4 		yes so sorry sir !
_t4 
_t4 		when Gordon was repaired again , he took Sir Topham Hatt to the new station for its second official opening . 
_t4 		this time he arrived safely , an(d) everyone clapped and cheered as he pulled in . 
_t4 		xxx !
